**Title:** Efficient vs. Inefficient Data Handling in Swift iOS

**Summary:**  The key difference lies in leveraging Swift's optimized data structures and avoiding unnecessary object creation.  Efficient code prioritizes immutability and avoids repeated computations, while inefficient code leads to performance bottlenecks and memory leaks.


**Good Code:**

```swift
import UIKit

struct Person {
    let name: String
    let age: Int
}

func processPeopleEfficiently(people: [Person]) -> [String] {
    // Use map for efficient transformation.  Immutability avoids copies.
    return people.map { $0.name } 
}

func findOldestPersonEfficiently(people: [Person]) -> Person? {
    //Uses reduce for a single pass.  Avoids nested loops.
    return people.reduce(nil) { (currentOldest, person) in
        guard let currentOldest = currentOldest else { return person }
        return currentOldest.age > person.age ? currentOldest : person
    }
}

// Example usage
let people = [Person(name: "Alice", age: 30), Person(name: "Bob", age: 25), Person(name: "Charlie", age: 35)]
let names = processPeopleEfficiently(people: people)
let oldest = findOldestPersonEfficiently(people: people)

print("Names: \(names)") // Output: Names: ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]
print("Oldest: \(oldest?.name ?? "Nobody")") // Output: Oldest: Charlie

```


**Bad Code:**

```swift
import UIKit

class PersonClass { //Using a class unnecessarily.
    var name: String
    var age: Int
    init(name: String, age: Int) {
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
    }
}

func processPeopleInefficiently(people: [PersonClass]) -> [String] {
    var names = [String]() //Creating a mutable array, less efficient.
    for person in people {
        names.append(person.name) // Appending repeatedly is less efficient than map.
    }
    return names
}

func findOldestPersonInefficiently(people: [PersonClass]) -> PersonClass? {
    var oldestPerson: PersonClass? = nil //Mutable variable.
    for i in 0..<people.count {
        for j in 0..<people.count { //Nested loops! O(n^2)
            if oldestPerson == nil || people[i].age > people[j].age {
                oldestPerson = people[i]
            }
        }
    }
    return oldestPerson
}


// Example Usage (same as above, but with bad code)
let peopleClass = [PersonClass(name: "Alice", age: 30), PersonClass(name: "Bob", age: 25), PersonClass(name: "Charlie", age: 35)]
let namesBad = processPeopleInefficiently(people: peopleClass)
let oldestBad = findOldestPersonInefficiently(people: peopleClass)

print("Names (bad): \(namesBad)") // Output: Names (bad): ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]
print("Oldest (bad): \(oldestBad?.name ?? "Nobody")") // Output: Oldest (bad): Charlie

```

**Key Takeaways:**

* **Immutability:** Using structs (value types) and immutable variables leads to safer and more efficient code due to reduced copying and potential for unexpected side effects.
* **Functional Programming:** Leveraging higher-order functions like `map` and `reduce` results in cleaner, more concise, and often more performant code than explicit loops.
* **Algorithm Efficiency:**  Choosing the right algorithm significantly impacts performance.  The bad code's nested loops are O(n^2), whereas the good code's `reduce` is O(n), resulting in dramatically better performance for larger datasets.
* **Memory Management:**  The good code avoids unnecessary object creation and mutations, reducing memory pressure and the risk of memory leaks, particularly important in apps with long lifecycles.
* **Readability:** The functional approach in the good code leads to increased readability and maintainability.
