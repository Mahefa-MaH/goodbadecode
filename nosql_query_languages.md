**Title:** NoSQL Query Languages: Efficient vs. Inefficient Approaches

**Summary:** NoSQL query languages vary significantly in their expressiveness and efficiency.  Efficient queries leverage database-specific features for optimized performance, while inefficient queries can lead to performance bottlenecks and scalability issues.

**Good Code (Example using MongoDB's aggregation framework):**

```javascript
db.collection('products').aggregate([
  {
    $match: { category: "electronics", price: { $gt: 100 } }
  },
  {
    $group: {
      _id: "$category",
      avgPrice: { $avg: "$price" },
      count: { $sum: 1 }
    }
  },
  {
    $sort: { avgPrice: -1 }
  }
])
```

**Bad Code (Example using MongoDB find with excessive client-side processing):**

```javascript
let products = db.collection('products').find({ category: "electronics", price: { $gt: 100 } }).toArray();
let avgPrice = 0;
let count = 0;
for (let product of products) {
  avgPrice += product.price;
  count++;
}
avgPrice /= count;
//Further sorting and manipulation on the client-side
```


**Key Takeaways:**

* **Server-side processing:** The "good" code leverages the database's built-in aggregation framework to perform calculations (average price, count) on the server, significantly reducing the data transferred to the client.  The "bad" code fetches all matching documents and performs calculations client-side, impacting performance and network traffic, especially with large datasets.
* **Efficiency:**  Database aggregation pipelines are optimized for these types of operations, often using indexes for faster retrieval.  Client-side processing is generally much slower and less efficient.
* **Scalability:**  The server-side approach scales better because the database handles the computationally intensive tasks. The client-side approach will become increasingly slow and resource-intensive as the dataset grows.
* **Readability and Maintainability:** The "good" code is more concise and easier to understand, focusing on expressing the query logic clearly. The "bad" code mixes database interaction with complex client-side logic, making it harder to maintain and debug.


Note:  The examples showcase MongoDB, but the core principles of efficient vs. inefficient query writing apply to other NoSQL databases as well, although the specific syntax and features will vary.
