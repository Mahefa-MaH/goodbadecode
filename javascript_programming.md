**Title:** Efficient JavaScript Array Filtering: Two Approaches

**Summary:**  This example demonstrates the difference between using `filter()` directly versus using a `for` loop for filtering an array in JavaScript. The `filter()` method offers a more concise, readable, and often more performant solution for filtering arrays based on a condition.

**Good Code:**

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];

const evenNumbers = numbers.filter(number => number % 2 === 0);

console.log(evenNumbers); // Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

**Bad Code:**

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
const evenNumbers = [];

for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
  if (numbers[i] % 2 === 0) {
    evenNumbers.push(numbers[i]);
  }
}

console.log(evenNumbers); // Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

**Key Takeaways:**

* **Readability:** The `filter()` method is significantly more concise and easier to understand than the `for` loop approach.  It clearly expresses the intent of filtering the array.
* **Maintainability:**  The `filter()` method is less prone to errors compared to manual loop iteration.  It's easier to modify or extend the filtering logic.
* **Performance (often):** While the performance difference might be negligible for small arrays,  `filter()` is often optimized internally and can be more efficient for larger datasets.  The `for` loop requires more explicit steps, potentially leading to slower execution.
* **Functional Programming Paradigm:** Using `filter()` aligns with functional programming principles, promoting cleaner and more predictable code. The `for` loop exemplifies a more imperative style.
* **Security:** Both methods are generally secure if the filtering logic is properly implemented.  However, the `filter()`'s conciseness may reduce the potential for subtle errors that could introduce security vulnerabilities in complex scenarios.
