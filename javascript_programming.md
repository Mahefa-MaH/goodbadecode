**Title:** Efficient vs. Inefficient JavaScript Array Filtering

**Summary:** The key difference lies in leveraging built-in JavaScript array methods for optimized performance versus manually iterating, which can lead to increased complexity and slower execution.  The efficient method minimizes memory allocation and utilizes optimized native code.

**Good Code:**

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];

// Efficient filtering using filter()
const evenNumbers = numbers.filter(number => number % 2 === 0);

console.log(evenNumbers); // Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

**Bad Code:**

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
const evenNumbers = [];

// Inefficient manual iteration
for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
  if (numbers[i] % 2 === 0) {
    evenNumbers.push(numbers[i]);
  }
}

console.log(evenNumbers); // Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```


**Key Takeaways:**

* **Readability and Maintainability:** The `filter()` method is more concise and easier to understand, improving code readability and maintainability.
* **Performance:**  The `filter()` method is generally faster and more efficient because it's optimized within the JavaScript engine.  Manual iteration requires more steps and potentially more memory allocation.
* **Conciseness:**  The `filter()` method expresses the intent more clearly and requires fewer lines of code.
* **Avoids potential errors:** Manual iteration increases the risk of off-by-one errors or other index-related issues, which are avoided with the higher-level function.
* **Leverages native optimizations:** The JavaScript engine is highly optimized for its built-in array methods, leading to better performance compared to manually written loops.  This optimization is often invisible to the developer.
