**Title:** Efficient JavaScript Array Filtering:  `filter()` vs. `for` loop

**Summary:**  While both `filter()` and `for` loops can filter JavaScript arrays, `filter()` provides a more concise and functional approach, improving readability and maintainability, while `for` loops offer greater control but are often more verbose and prone to errors.


**Good Code:**

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];

const evenNumbers = numbers.filter(number => number % 2 === 0);

console.log(evenNumbers); // Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```


**Bad Code:**

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
const evenNumbers = [];

for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
  if (numbers[i] % 2 === 0) {
    evenNumbers.push(numbers[i]);
  }
}

console.log(evenNumbers); // Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```


**Key Takeaways:**

* **Readability:** The `filter()` method is significantly more concise and easier to understand, immediately conveying its purpose. The `for` loop requires more lines of code and careful examination to grasp its function.
* **Maintainability:**  The `filter()` method is more maintainable; changes are easier to implement and less prone to introducing bugs.  The `for` loop is more complex and has more potential points of failure.
* **Functional Programming Paradigm:** `filter()` promotes a functional programming style, which enhances code clarity and testability. The `for` loop takes a more imperative approach.
* **Error Reduction:** The `filter()` method inherently handles array iteration safely, minimizing the risk of off-by-one errors or other common indexing mistakes that frequently occur with manual `for` loops.
* **Efficiency (in some cases):** While the performance difference might be negligible for small arrays,  `filter()` can be slightly more efficient in certain JavaScript engines due to optimizations built into the method.  However, this should not be the primary reason for choosing `filter()`.  Readability and maintainability are more important.
