**Title:** Efficient JavaScript Array Manipulation: `map` vs. `for` loop

**Summary:**  While both `map()` and `for` loops iterate over arrays, `map()` provides a more concise and functional approach for transforming array elements, enhancing readability and maintainability compared to manual `for` loops prone to errors.


**Good Code:**

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

const doubledNumbers = numbers.map(number => number * 2);

console.log(doubledNumbers); // Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

**Bad Code:**

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const doubledNumbers = [];

for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
  doubledNumbers.push(numbers[i] * 2);
}

console.log(doubledNumbers); // Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

```

**Key Takeaways:**

* **Readability and Conciseness:** `map()` is significantly more readable and concise than the equivalent `for` loop.  The intent – transforming each element – is immediately clear.
* **Maintainability:** `map()` reduces the risk of off-by-one errors or other common `for` loop pitfalls.  It's easier to understand and modify.
* **Functional Programming Paradigm:** `map()` promotes a functional programming style, leading to cleaner, more testable code.  It avoids mutable state changes directly within the loop.
* **Potential for Improved Performance (in some cases):** While the performance difference might be negligible for small arrays, `map()` can sometimes be optimized better by JavaScript engines.  However, this is engine-dependent and not a guaranteed advantage.
* **Error Handling:**  While not shown in this example, `map()` allows for more elegant error handling using techniques like try...catch blocks within the callback function.  Managing errors in a `for` loop can become more complex.
