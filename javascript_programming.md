**Title:** Efficient JavaScript Array Manipulation: `map` vs. `forEach`

**Summary:** While both `map` and `forEach` iterate over arrays, `map` transforms each element and returns a new array, whereas `forEach` only performs side effects without returning a value. This crucial difference impacts code readability and functionality.


**Good Code:**

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

// Using map to create a new array with squared values
const squaredNumbers = numbers.map(number => number * number); 

console.log(squaredNumbers); // Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]

//Using forEach to modify an array in place
let doubledNumbers = [];
numbers.forEach(number => doubledNumbers.push(number * 2));
console.log(doubledNumbers); //Output: [2,4,6,8,10]

```


**Bad Code:**

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let squaredNumbers = []; // declared outside the loop

numbers.forEach(function(number) {
  squaredNumbers.push(number * number);  //Mutates external variable
});

console.log(squaredNumbers); // Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25] (correct output, but bad practice)

//Attempting to chain map to return a value after a side effect within forEach is messy and prone to errors
const badAttempt = numbers.forEach(number => number * number).map(x => x*2); //Returns undefined
console.log(badAttempt) //Output: undefined
```

**Key Takeaways:**

* **Functional Purity:** `map` promotes functional purity by returning a new array without modifying the original.  This improves code readability, maintainability, and reduces the risk of unexpected side effects.  `forEach`'s side-effect nature can make debugging harder.
* **Readability and Intent:** The `map` function clearly expresses the intent of transforming the array, making the code easier to understand. Using `forEach` for transformations requires extra steps and variables, obscuring the transformation process.
* **Chaining:** `map` is easily chainable with other array methods creating elegant and efficient functional pipelines. `forEach` does not return a value, preventing chaining.
* **Error Handling:**  With map, errors during the transformation will be reflected in the resulting array. `forEach` errors may be harder to catch if they aren't explicitly handled within the callback.  The `forEach` method attempts to chain operations after the side effects occur, resulting in an undefined output.
* **Immutability:**  `map` helps maintain immutability, a key principle in functional programming, by leaving the original array untouched. This is crucial for predictable and easier to reason about code.
