**Title:** Efficient JavaScript Array Iteration: `forEach` vs. `for` Loop

**Summary:** While both `forEach` and traditional `for` loops iterate over arrays, `forEach` offers a more concise and readable syntax for simple iterations, while `for` loops provide greater control and flexibility for complex scenarios.


**Good Code:**

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let sum = 0;

// Using forEach for a simple summation
numbers.forEach(number => {
  sum += number;
});

console.log("Sum using forEach:", sum);


//Using for loop for more complex scenario with early exit.
let product = 1;
for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
  if(numbers[i] === 0){
    product = 0;
    break; //Early exit if 0 is encountered
  }
  product *= numbers[i];
}
console.log("Product using for loop:", product);


```


**Bad Code:**

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let sum = 0;

// Bad: Modifying the array during iteration with forEach (unexpected behavior)
numbers.forEach((number, index) => {
  if (number % 2 === 0) {
    numbers.splice(index, 1); //Removes even numbers. This will lead to index issues.
  }
  sum += number;
});

console.log("Sum (Bad Code):", sum); //Inaccurate sum due to array modification during iteration

//Bad:  Using a for loop without proper bounds checking.
let productBad = 1;
for (let i = 0; i <= numbers.length; i++) { // Off-by-one error
    productBad *= numbers[i]; // Potential undefined access
}
console.log("Product (Bad Code):", productBad); // Potential NaN or incorrect product.

```

**Key Takeaways:**

* **Readability:** `forEach` often leads to more concise and readable code for simple iterations, improving maintainability.
* **Flexibility:**  `for` loops offer more control, allowing for complex logic (like early exits, break conditions,  and nested loops), and easier handling of index manipulation.
* **Error Prevention:**  Modifying the array during iteration with `forEach` (as shown in the bad example) leads to unpredictable behavior and bugs.  `for` loops, while allowing modification, require explicit index management, making potential errors easier to catch.
* **Efficiency:** For simple iterations, `forEach` and `for` loops have comparable performance.  For complex scenarios requiring early termination or specific index manipulation, a `for` loop might be slightly more efficient due to avoiding the function call overhead of `forEach`.
* **Maintainability:** The clear structure and simple syntax of properly used `for` and `forEach` contribute to improved code maintainability. Avoiding array modification during iteration significantly improves code predictability and ease of debugging.
