**Title:** Efficient JavaScript Array Filtering: Good vs. Bad Practices

**Summary:**  The key difference lies in utilizing built-in JavaScript array methods for efficient filtering versus manually iterating, which is less concise and potentially slower.  Efficient filtering avoids unnecessary loops and leverages optimized native functions.

**Good Code:**

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];

// Filter even numbers using the filter() method
const evenNumbers = numbers.filter(number => number % 2 === 0);

console.log(evenNumbers); // Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]


//Filter objects based on a property
const products = [
  { name: "Apple", price: 1.00, inStock: true },
  { name: "Banana", price: 0.50, inStock: false },
  { name: "Orange", price: 0.75, inStock: true }
];

const inStockProducts = products.filter(product => product.inStock);
console.log(inStockProducts); //Output: [{ name: "Apple", price: 1.00, inStock: true }, { name: "Orange", price: 0.75, inStock: true }]

```

**Bad Code:**

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
const evenNumbers = [];

// Manually iterating and filtering even numbers
for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
  if (numbers[i] % 2 === 0) {
    evenNumbers.push(numbers[i]);
  }
}

console.log(evenNumbers); // Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]


const products = [
  { name: "Apple", price: 1.00, inStock: true },
  { name: "Banana", price: 0.50, inStock: false },
  { name: "Orange", price: 0.75, inStock: true }
];

const inStockProducts = [];
for (let i = 0; i < products.length; i++){
    if(products[i].inStock){
        inStockProducts.push(products[i]);
    }
}
console.log(inStockProducts); //Output: [{ name: "Apple", price: 1.00, inStock: true }, { name: "Orange", price: 0.75, inStock: true }]
```

**Key Takeaways:**

* **Readability and Maintainability:** The `filter()` method makes the code significantly more concise and easier to understand.  The intent is immediately clear.
* **Efficiency:**  The built-in `filter()` method is generally optimized for performance, particularly with larger arrays. Manual iteration can be slower, especially for complex filtering logic.
* **Conciseness:**  The good code requires fewer lines of code, reducing the chance of errors and improving overall code quality.
* **Functional Programming Paradigm:** Using `filter()` promotes a more functional programming style, leading to cleaner and more modular code.
* **Reduced Error Prone Code:** Manual loops are more prone to off-by-one errors or other indexing issues, whereas the built-in methods handle these details internally.
