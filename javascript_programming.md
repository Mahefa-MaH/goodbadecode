**Title:** Efficient JavaScript Array Iteration: `forEach` vs. `for` Loop

**Summary:** While both `forEach` and traditional `for` loops iterate over arrays, `forEach` offers cleaner syntax for simple iterations, while `for` loops provide more control and performance advantages in complex scenarios or when dealing with performance-critical applications.

**Good Code:**

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let sum = 0;

// Using for loop for better performance and control (especially with large arrays)
for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
  sum += numbers[i];
}

console.log("Sum:", sum);


//Using forEach for simple iterations - good readability
const numbers2 = [10,20,30,40,50];
let sum2 = 0;
numbers2.forEach(number => {
    sum2 += number;
});
console.log("Sum2:", sum2);

//Example with early exit capability (only available with for loop)
const numbers3 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let sum3 = 0;
for (let i = 0; i < numbers3.length; i++) {
  if (numbers3[i] === 3) break; //Exit loop early if condition met.
  sum3 += numbers3[i];
}

console.log("Sum3:", sum3);
```


**Bad Code:**

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let sum = 0;

// Modifying the array during iteration with forEach - can lead to unexpected behavior
numbers.forEach((number, index) => {
  if (number % 2 === 0) {
    numbers.splice(index, 1); // Removing even numbers
  }
  sum += number;
});

console.log("Sum (Bad Code):", sum); //Incorrect sum due to array modification during iteration.
```

**Key Takeaways:**

* **Performance:** For large arrays, traditional `for` loops generally offer better performance because they avoid the overhead of function calls associated with `forEach`.
* **Control Flow:** `for` loops provide more control over the iteration process.  You can easily break out of the loop, continue to the next iteration, or use more complex logic for conditional iteration.  This is not possible with `forEach`.
* **Avoid Mutation:**  Modifying the array while iterating with `forEach` (or any array iterator method) can lead to unexpected behavior and bugs.  Use a `for` loop to maintain control if array modification is required within the loop.
* **Readability:** For simple iterations where you just need to process each element, `forEach` can be more concise and readable.
* **Error Handling:**  `for` loops allow for more fine-grained error handling within the loop.  With `forEach`, you're limited in how you can handle errors that occur during iteration.
