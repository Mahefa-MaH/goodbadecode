**Title:** Efficient JavaScript Array Filtering: Concise vs. Inefficient

**Summary:**  The key difference lies in utilizing the built-in `filter()` method for efficient array manipulation versus manually iterating with a `for` loop, which is slower and more prone to errors.

**Good Code:**

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];

const evenNumbers = numbers.filter(number => number % 2 === 0);

console.log(evenNumbers); // Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

**Bad Code:**

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
const evenNumbers = [];

for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
  if (numbers[i] % 2 === 0) {
    evenNumbers.push(numbers[i]);
  }
}

console.log(evenNumbers); // Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

**Key Takeaways:**

* **Readability and Maintainability:** The `filter()` method is significantly more concise and easier to understand than the manual `for` loop approach. This improves code readability and reduces the chance of errors during maintenance.
* **Efficiency:** The built-in `filter()` method is generally optimized for performance, making it faster than a manually written loop, especially for larger arrays.  The engine can potentially employ internal optimizations not easily replicated in a custom loop.
* **Conciseness:**  The good code example is shorter and less verbose, leading to cleaner and more manageable code.
* **Reduced Error Potential:** Manual loops increase the risk of off-by-one errors, incorrect index handling, or forgetting to handle edge cases.  `filter()` handles these implicitly.
* **Functional Programming Paradigm:** Using `filter()` promotes a functional programming style, which often leads to more modular and testable code.
