**Title:** Efficient String Reversal in JavaScript

**Summary:**  The key difference lies in utilizing built-in methods for efficient string manipulation versus manually iterating, which is less efficient and prone to errors.  The good code leverages JavaScript's `split`, `reverse`, and `join` methods for concise and optimized string reversal.

**Good Code:**

```javascript
function reverseStringEfficient(str) {
  if (typeof str !== 'string') {
    throw new Error('Input must be a string.');
  }
  return str.split('').reverse().join('');
}

//Example usage
console.log(reverseStringEfficient("hello")); // olleh
console.log(reverseStringEfficient(123)); // throws an error
```

**Bad Code:**

```javascript
function reverseStringInefficient(str) {
  let reversed = "";
  for (let i = str.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    reversed += str[i];
  }
  return reversed;
}

// Example usage
console.log(reverseStringInefficient("hello")); // olleh
```


**Key Takeaways:**

* **Efficiency:** The good code uses built-in JavaScript methods optimized for performance.  The `split`, `reverse`, and `join` operations are generally faster than manual string concatenation in a loop (as in the bad code).  String concatenation in a loop creates numerous intermediate strings, leading to increased memory usage and slower execution.

* **Readability:** The good code is more concise and easier to understand.  Its intent is immediately clear, whereas the bad code requires more effort to decipher the logic.

* **Error Handling:** The good code includes error handling to check if the input is a string, preventing unexpected behavior or crashes. The bad code lacks this crucial error handling.

* **Maintainability:** The good code is easier to maintain and modify.  Its simplicity reduces the risk of introducing bugs during future updates.

* **Security:** While not explicitly demonstrated here,  the good codeâ€™s input validation prevents potential vulnerabilities that could arise from unexpected input types (e.g., if the input contained malicious code).  The bad code is vulnerable to such issues.
