**Title:** Efficient JavaScript Array Manipulation: `map` vs. `forEach`

**Summary:** While both `map` and `forEach` iterate over arrays, `map` transforms each element and returns a new array, whereas `forEach` performs side effects without returning a value.  This fundamental difference impacts code readability and maintainability.

**Good Code:**

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

// Using map to create a new array with doubled values
const doubledNumbers = numbers.map(number => number * 2);

console.log(doubledNumbers); // Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]


//Using map with objects
const users = [
  { id: 1, name: 'Alice' },
  { id: 2, name: 'Bob' }
];

const userIds = users.map(user => user.id);
console.log(userIds); // Output: [1, 2]


```

**Bad Code:**

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let doubledNumbers = [];

// Using forEach with side effects to modify an external array
numbers.forEach(number => {
  doubledNumbers.push(number * 2);
});

console.log(doubledNumbers); // Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

//Bad Example with Objects - Modifying original array
const users = [
  { id: 1, name: 'Alice' },
  { id: 2, name: 'Bob' }
];

users.forEach(user => {
  user.name = user.name.toUpperCase();
});
console.log(users); //Output: [{id:1, name:'ALICE'},{id:2, name:'BOB'}] - Original array mutated
```


**Key Takeaways:**

* **Functional Purity:** `map` is a pure function; it doesn't modify the original array and always returns a predictable result based on its input.  `forEach`, on the other hand, often involves side effects, making code harder to reason about and test.
* **Readability and Intent:** `map` clearly expresses the intent to transform elements and create a new array. `forEach` requires additional context to understand its purpose.  The use of `forEach` to populate a separate array is less clear and less efficient.
* **Maintainability:** Code using `map` tends to be more concise, easier to debug, and less prone to errors caused by accidental mutations. The bad `forEach` example with objects shows how modifying the original array can have unintended consequences.
* **Efficiency (In some cases):** While the difference might be negligible for small arrays, for large datasets, `map` can potentially offer slight performance advantages due to its functional nature and optimized implementations in JavaScript engines.  The creation of a new array avoids the overhead of modifying an existing one in place.
