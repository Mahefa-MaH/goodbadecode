**Title:** Efficient JavaScript Array Manipulation: Map vs. For Loop

**Summary:**  `map()` provides a concise, functional approach to array transformation, enhancing readability and maintainability compared to manual `for` loops which are prone to errors and less expressive.  `map()` also avoids potential issues with scope and accidental modification of the original array.


**Good Code:**

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

const doubledNumbers = numbers.map(number => number * 2);

console.log(doubledNumbers); // Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
console.log(numbers); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] - Original array unchanged.
```


**Bad Code:**

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const doubledNumbers = [];

for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
  doubledNumbers[i] = numbers[i] * 2;
  numbers[i] *=2; //Accidentally modifying the original array
}

console.log(doubledNumbers); // Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
console.log(numbers); // Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10] - Original array modified!
```


**Key Takeaways:**

* **Readability and Maintainability:** `map()` is significantly more concise and easier to understand than a manual `for` loop, especially for complex transformations.  This reduces the chance of introducing bugs.
* **Immutability:** The good code example utilizes `map()` which creates a *new* array, leaving the original array untouched.  This is crucial for predictable program behavior and prevents unintended side effects. The bad example directly modifies the original array which may have unintended consequences in larger programs.
* **Error Reduction:**  The concise syntax of `map()` minimizes the opportunity for common `for` loop errors like off-by-one errors or incorrect index manipulation.
* **Functional Programming Paradigm:**  `map()` promotes a functional programming style, leading to more modular and testable code.
* **Efficiency (Minor):** While the performance difference might be negligible for small arrays, `map()` can be slightly more efficient in some JavaScript engines due to optimizations.
