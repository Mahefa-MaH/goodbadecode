**Title:** Efficient vs. Inefficient JavaScript Array Iteration

**Summary:**  The key difference lies in leveraging native JavaScript methods like `forEach` for cleaner, more efficient iteration compared to using traditional `for` loops which are prone to off-by-one errors and are less readable.

**Good Code:**

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let sum = 0;

numbers.forEach(number => {
  sum += number;
});

console.log("Sum:", sum); // Output: Sum: 15

//Alternative using reduce for conciseness:
const sum2 = numbers.reduce((acc, num) => acc + num, 0);
console.log("Sum (reduce):", sum2); // Output: Sum (reduce): 15

```

**Bad Code:**

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let sum = 0;

for (let i = 0; i <= numbers.length; i++) { //Off-by-one error!
  sum += numbers[i]; 
}

console.log("Sum:", sum); //Output: NaN (due to accessing index out of bounds)


//Another example with unnecessary variable
let index = 0;
let numbersSum = 0;
for(;index < numbers.length; index++){
    numbersSum += numbers[index];
}
console.log("Sum:", numbersSum); //Output: 15, but less readable and efficient
```


**Key Takeaways:**

* **Readability:** `forEach` and `reduce` are more concise and easier to understand, improving code maintainability.
* **Efficiency:**  `forEach` and `reduce` are often optimized by the JavaScript engine, potentially leading to better performance, especially for large arrays.
* **Error Prevention:**  The `for` loop example demonstrates a common off-by-one error;  `forEach` and `reduce` eliminate this risk.
* **Maintainability:**  The shorter, more declarative style of `forEach` and `reduce` reduces the chances of introducing bugs during future modifications.
* **Functional Programming:** Using higher-order functions like `forEach` and `reduce` promotes a more functional programming style which can lead to cleaner and more modular code.  The `reduce` example particularly exemplifies this.
