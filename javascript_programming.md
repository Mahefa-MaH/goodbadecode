**Title:** Efficient JavaScript Array Iteration: `forEach` vs. `for` loop

**Summary:** While both `forEach` and traditional `for` loops iterate over arrays, `forEach` offers a more concise syntax for simple iterations, while `for` loops provide greater control and flexibility for complex scenarios or when needing to break or continue iteration.


**Good Code:**

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let sum = 0;

// Using forEach for a simple summation
numbers.forEach(number => {
  sum += number;
});

console.log("Sum using forEach:", sum);


//Using for loop for more complex scenario - stopping early if a condition is met.
let foundEven = false;
for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
  if (numbers[i] % 2 === 0) {
    console.log("Found an even number:", numbers[i]);
    foundEven = true;
    break; //Exit the loop early after finding an even number
  }
}

if(!foundEven){
    console.log("No even numbers found.")
}
```

**Bad Code:**

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let sum = 0;

// Inefficient and error-prone loop with implicit global variable
for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
    sum = sum + numbers[i]; // less readable than += operator
}

//Modifying the array while iterating - potential index issues
for(let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++){
    if(numbers[i] > 2){
        numbers.splice(i,1); // removes element from the array
        i--; //Adjust the index to account for the removed element
    }
}

console.log("Sum using bad for loop:", sum);
console.log("Modified array:", numbers); //Demonstrates side effects.
```


**Key Takeaways:**

* **Readability and Conciseness:** `forEach` provides a cleaner, more readable syntax for simple iterations, reducing code clutter.  The good code examples are more succinct and easier to understand.
* **Flexibility and Control:** Traditional `for` loops offer greater control, allowing you to easily break or continue iteration based on conditions, something `forEach` does not directly support. The `break` statement example demonstrates this.
* **Avoiding Side Effects:** Modifying the array during iteration using `splice` in the bad code can lead to unexpected results and index errors.  The good example using a `for` loop illustrates how to correctly handle this scenario.
* **Scope and Maintainability:** The bad code example uses an implicit global variable (`sum`), increasing the risk of unintended modifications and making the code harder to maintain. The good code keeps the `sum` variable properly scoped.
* **Efficiency:** While the performance difference between `forEach` and a `for` loop is often negligible for smaller arrays, for very large datasets, a `for` loop can potentially offer a slight performance advantage as it avoids the overhead of function calls inherent in `forEach`.  However, this difference is often insignificant and readability should be prioritized.
