**Title:** Efficient JavaScript Array Manipulation: `map` vs. `forEach`

**Summary:**  `map()` creates a new array by transforming each element of an existing array, while `forEach()` iterates over an array and performs a side effect without returning a new array.  Choosing the right method depends on whether you need to produce a transformed array or simply modify existing data.


**Good Code:**

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

// Using map to create a new array with doubled values
const doubledNumbers = numbers.map(number => number * 2); 

console.log(doubledNumbers); // Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
console.log(numbers);       // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] (original array unchanged)


//Using forEach to modify an object within an array.
const users = [{id:1, name:'Alice'}, {id:2, name:'Bob'}];

users.forEach(user => user.age = 30);

console.log(users); // Output: [{id:1, name:'Alice', age:30}, {id:2, name:'Bob', age:30}]

```

**Bad Code:**

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

// Incorrect use of forEach to create a new array (inefficient and error-prone)
let doubledNumbers = [];
numbers.forEach(number => doubledNumbers.push(number * 2));

console.log(doubledNumbers); // Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]


//Modifying the array in place without creating a copy which could lead to unintended consequences.
let numbers2 = [1,2,3];
numbers2.forEach( (num, index) => numbers2[index] = num * 2);
console.log(numbers2); //Output: [2, 4, 6] - Original array modified.

```


**Key Takeaways:**

* **Readability and Intent:** `map()` clearly expresses the intention to create a new transformed array, enhancing code readability.  `forEach` is best for side effects.
* **Functional Purity:** `map()` adheres to functional programming principles by returning a new array without modifying the original, preventing unexpected side effects.
* **Efficiency:**  While the difference might seem minor for small arrays, `map()` can be slightly more efficient in some JavaScript engines because it's optimized for array transformations.  The `forEach` with `push` creates additional overhead for array manipulation.
* **Maintainability:**  The functional approach of `map()` generally leads to more maintainable and testable code compared to modifying an array in place with `forEach` as shown in the bad example.  Using `forEach` to create a new array is less readable and makes it harder to see the purpose.
* **Error Prevention:**  Using `map()` for transformations reduces the risk of accidentally modifying the original array, a common source of bugs in imperative programming styles.
