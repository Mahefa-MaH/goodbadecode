**Title:** Efficient JavaScript Array Manipulation: `map()` vs. `forEach()`

**Summary:** While both `map()` and `forEach()` iterate over arrays, `map()` transforms each element and returns a new array, whereas `forEach()` only performs side effects and returns `undefined`.  This fundamental difference impacts code readability and functionality.

**Good Code:**

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

// Using map() to square each number and create a new array
const squaredNumbers = numbers.map(number => number * number);

console.log(squaredNumbers); // Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]

//Using map with object manipulation

const users = [
  {id: 1, name: 'John'},
  {id: 2, name: 'Jane'}
];

const userIds = users.map(user => user.id);

console.log(userIds); //Output: [1,2]


```

**Bad Code:**

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let squaredNumbers = []; //Mutable array

//Using forEach() to mutate the external array.  Error-prone and less readable.
numbers.forEach(number => {
  squaredNumbers.push(number * number);
});

console.log(squaredNumbers); // Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]

//Mutating an array inside forEach. Can cause unexpected side effects.

let users = [
  {id: 1, name: 'John'},
  {id: 2, name: 'Jane'}
];

users.forEach(user => {
  user.name = user.name.toUpperCase();
});

console.log(users); // Output: [{id: 1, name: 'JOHN'}, {id: 2, name: 'JANE'}]

```

**Key Takeaways:**

* **Readability and Intent:** `map()` clearly expresses the intent to transform elements and create a new array.  `forEach()`'s intent is less clear, especially when used for transformations.
* **Immutability:**  Using `map()` promotes immutability, a crucial aspect of functional programming and reducing bugs. The original array remains unchanged.  `forEach()` often leads to mutable code, making it harder to reason about and debug.
* **Return Value:** `map()` returns a new array, allowing for chaining with other array methods. `forEach()` returns `undefined`, limiting chaining possibilities.
* **Functional Purity:** `map()` is a pure function â€“ its output depends only on its input. `forEach()` often performs side effects (modifying external variables), making it impure and less predictable.
* **Error Handling:**  The `forEach` example with the `users` array directly modifies the original array. This can lead to unexpected side effects and errors, especially in larger applications.  Using map and creating new arrays would prevent this.
