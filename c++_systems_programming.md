**Title:** Efficient C++ Memory Management: `unique_ptr` vs. Raw Pointers

**Summary:**  `std::unique_ptr` provides automatic memory management, preventing leaks and dangling pointers, unlike raw pointers which require manual allocation and deallocation. This difference significantly improves code safety and maintainability.

**Good Code:**

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <memory>

void processData(std::unique_ptr<int[]> data) {
  if (data) {  //Check for null pointer
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
      std::cout << data[i] << " ";
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;
  }
}

int main() {
  // Allocate memory on the heap using std::make_unique
  auto data = std::make_unique<int[]>(10); 
  for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
    data[i] = i * 2;
  }

  processData(std::move(data)); //Ownership transferred

  // data is automatically deleted here, no memory leak.
  return 0;
}
```

**Bad Code:**

```c++
#include <iostream>

void processData(int* data) {
    if (data != nullptr) {
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
            std::cout << data[i] << " ";
        }
        std::cout << std::endl;
    }
}

int main() {
  int* data = new int[10];
  for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
    data[i] = i * 2;
  }

  processData(data); 
  delete[] data; // Easy to forget this, leading to memory leaks.

  return 0;
}

```


**Key Takeaways:**

* **Automatic Memory Management:** `unique_ptr` automatically deallocates memory when it goes out of scope, eliminating the risk of memory leaks.  Raw pointers require manual `delete[]`, which is error-prone.
* **Exception Safety:** In case of exceptions thrown within `processData`, `unique_ptr` ensures that the memory is still correctly deallocated. Raw pointers may leave leaked memory if an exception occurs before `delete[]` is called.
* **Ownership and Transfer:** `std::move` efficiently transfers ownership of the `unique_ptr`, preventing double deletion.  With raw pointers, this requires careful manual handling to avoid errors.
* **Improved Readability:**  `unique_ptr` clearly expresses intent â€“  it shows that the pointer manages ownership of the allocated memory, improving code clarity and maintainability.
* **Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII):** The good example leverages RAII, a fundamental C++ principle that ties resource management (memory in this case) to object lifetimes.
