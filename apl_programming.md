**Title:** APL: Concise vs. Obscure Array Operations

**Summary:**  APL's power lies in its concise array operations, but overly dense code can severely impact readability and maintainability.  The key difference lies in balancing conciseness with clarity, favoring explicitness over cryptic shortcuts when necessary.

**Good Code:**

```apl
grades ← 90 85 78 92 88
passed ← grades ≥ 80
avgGrade ← (+/grades) ÷ ⊂⍴grades  ⍝  Sum, divide by count
output ← 'Passing Grades: ', ⊂⍕passed, 'Average Grade: ', ⊂⍕avgGrade
output
```

**Bad Code:**

```apl
grades ← 90 85 78 92 88
'Passing Grades: ', ⊂⍕grades≥80, 'Average Grade: ', ⊂⍕(+/grades)÷⍴grades
```


**Key Takeaways:**

* **Readability:** The good code uses intermediate variables (`passed`, `avgGrade`), making the logic much easier to follow.  The bad code crams everything into a single expression, hindering understanding.
* **Maintainability:**  Intermediate variables improve debugging and modification. Changing the passing grade, for instance, is simpler in the good code.
* **Clarity:** The good code explicitly shows the calculation of the average, separating the sum and division operations. The bad code combines them in a way that's harder to parse.
* **Documentation:** While APL's syntax is concise, comments (though not shown here for brevity) are even more crucial for complex operations, something the good code example would benefit from.
* **Error Handling (Implicit):** Although not explicitly shown, the good code's structure allows for easier addition of error handling (e.g., checking for empty `grades`).  The bad code's dense structure makes this more challenging.
* **Security (Implicit):**  The good code’s modularity enhances security by making it easier to review and validate individual components. The monolithic nature of the bad code increases the risk of introducing vulnerabilities.


The `⊂` (enclose) function is used in both examples to ensure correct formatting of the output string, which is a common need when mixing numerical results with text strings in APL.  Note that APL dialects may vary slightly in syntax and function names.
