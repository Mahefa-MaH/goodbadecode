**Title:** Efficient Matrix Multiplication in MATLAB: A Comparison

**Summary:**  The key difference lies in leveraging MATLAB's optimized built-in functions for matrix multiplication versus explicit looping, which significantly impacts performance and readability.  Efficient vectorization avoids unnecessary overhead and promotes concise code.


**Good Code:**

```matlab
A = rand(1000, 1000);
B = rand(1000, 1000);

tic;
C = A * B;  % Efficient matrix multiplication using built-in operator
toc;

%Optional verification (uncomment for testing):
% sum(sum(C))

```

**Bad Code:**

```matlab
A = rand(1000, 1000);
B = rand(1000, 1000);

C = zeros(size(A,1), size(B,2));
tic;
for i = 1:size(A,1)
    for j = 1:size(B,2)
        for k = 1:size(A,2)
            C(i,j) = C(i,j) + A(i,k) * B(k,j);
        end
    end
end
toc;

%Optional verification (uncomment for testing):
% sum(sum(C))

```


**Key Takeaways:**

* **Performance:** The good code utilizes MATLAB's highly optimized built-in matrix multiplication operator (`*`), which is significantly faster than explicit looping (the bad code).  MATLAB's internal algorithms are often implemented in highly optimized C or Fortran code.
* **Readability:** The good code is much more concise and easier to understand.  The intent is immediately clear: perform matrix multiplication.
* **Maintainability:** The good code is simpler to maintain and debug.  Nested loops (bad code) increase complexity and the chances of introducing errors.
* **Vectorization:** The good code leverages vectorization, a core strength of MATLAB, allowing for parallel processing and efficient memory usage.  The bad code performs the same operation iteratively which is much less efficient.
* **Security:** Both examples are relatively secure in terms of memory management, but the bad code is more prone to errors that can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes (e.g., incorrect loop bounds).

**Note:** The `tic` and `toc` functions measure execution time, illustrating the performance difference.  The optional verification code checks that both methods yield the same result (within numerical tolerance).  You'll observe a dramatic difference in execution time when running these code snippets, particularly for larger matrices.
