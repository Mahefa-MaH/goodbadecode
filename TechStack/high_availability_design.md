**1. What is the single most important component to consider when designing for high availability?**

The single most important component to consider when designing for high availability is **redundancy**.  This encompasses multiple aspects: redundant hardware (servers, network devices, storage), redundant data (replication, backups), redundant power supplies, and redundant software processes (e.g., multiple instances of an application running concurrently).  Without redundancy, a single point of failure can bring down the entire system.


**2. How can I implement basic redundancy in a simple system?**

Basic redundancy in a simple system can be implemented using these techniques:

* **Load balancing:** Distribute traffic across multiple servers.  A simple load balancer (e.g., a round-robin DNS configuration or a basic hardware load balancer) can prevent a single server failure from impacting all users.
* **Database replication:**  Use a database system that supports replication (e.g., MySQL master-slave replication, PostgreSQL streaming replication).  This ensures that if the primary database goes down, a secondary copy is available.
* **File system mirroring or RAID:** Protect against hard drive failure by mirroring files to another drive or using RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks) technology.


**3. When is high availability absolutely critical for a system's success?**

High availability is absolutely critical for a system's success when:

* **Financial transactions are involved:**  Downtime can lead to significant financial losses and damage to reputation (e.g., online banking, e-commerce).
* **Life-critical systems are involved:**  Downtime can have serious consequences, even loss of life (e.g., medical devices, emergency services dispatch systems).
* **Reputation is paramount:** For businesses that rely on constant uptime to maintain customer trust and loyalty, downtime can be devastating (e.g., social media platforms, cloud service providers).
* **24/7 operations are required:**  Systems that must operate continuously, regardless of time of day or unexpected events, need high availability (e.g., power grids, air traffic control).



**4. What metric(s) would you use to validate the high availability of a system after implementation?**

Key metrics to validate high availability include:

* **Uptime:**  The percentage of time the system is operational.  Aim for 99.9% (or higher, depending on requirements) uptime.
* **Mean Time To Failure (MTTF):** The average time between failures.  A higher MTTF indicates greater reliability.
* **Mean Time To Recovery (MTTR):** The average time it takes to restore the system after a failure.  A lower MTTR is crucial for minimizing downtime.
* **Recovery Point Objective (RPO):** The maximum acceptable data loss in case of an outage.
* **Recovery Time Objective (RTO):** The maximum acceptable downtime after an outage.


**5. How did Amazon's architecture ensure high availability during peak shopping seasons like Black Friday?**

Amazon uses a highly distributed and fault-tolerant architecture to handle Black Friday traffic spikes. Key components include:

* **Massive scalability:**  Their infrastructure can dynamically scale up to handle increased demand.
* **Redundancy at all levels:**  Redundant servers, networks, databases, and data centers are employed throughout their system.
* **Microservices architecture:**  Breaking down applications into smaller, independent services allows for independent scaling and fault isolation.
* **Global infrastructure:** Distributing services across multiple geographical regions helps mitigate the impact of localized outages.
* **Sophisticated monitoring and automation:**  Real-time monitoring and automated responses to failures help maintain system stability.


**6. What specific design flaw led to a major outage and compromised high availability for a service at a company like Twitter?**

Twitter has experienced several outages over the years due to various design flaws. One common theme is related to **scaling challenges and insufficient capacity planning**.  For example, failures have been attributed to:

* **Overreliance on a single component:** A failure in a critical component (e.g., a database server or a key caching layer) can cascade and bring down the entire system if there isn't sufficient redundancy.
* **Insufficient monitoring and alerting:**  Lack of comprehensive monitoring and timely alerts can delay the detection and resolution of issues, prolonging outages.
* **Poorly designed caching strategies:**  Inadequate caching can lead to increased load on backend systems, increasing the risk of failure during peak traffic.
* **Lack of proper testing for extreme conditions:** Insufficient load testing and disaster recovery testing can expose vulnerabilities that only appear under high stress.


**7. When designing a new microservice, how would you factor in HA from the start?**

When designing a new microservice for high availability from the start:

* **Design for failure:** Assume components will fail and build in mechanisms to handle those failures gracefully (e.g., circuit breakers, retries, timeouts).
* **Stateless design:**  Make the microservice stateless, so that it can be easily replicated and scaled horizontally.  Store session data and other stateful information externally (e.g., in a database).
* **Health checks:** Implement health checks to allow monitoring systems to detect if the microservice is running correctly.
* **Multiple instances:** Deploy multiple instances of the microservice across different availability zones or data centers.
* **Load balancing:** Use a load balancer to distribute traffic across the multiple instances.
* **Message queues:** Utilize message queues for asynchronous communication to decouple services and handle temporary failures.
* **Database replication:** Ensure the database used by the microservice is replicated for high availability.
* **Monitoring and logging:** Comprehensive monitoring and logging is crucial for detecting and diagnosing problems quickly.
* **Automated rollbacks:** Implement mechanisms for automated rollbacks to previous versions in case of deployment failures.

By addressing these points from the design phase, you significantly increase the likelihood of building a robust and highly available microservice.
