Let's address your questions about component-based development (CBD).

**1. Core Components for CBD in Your Current Project:**

To identify core components in your existing project, look for self-contained, reusable units of functionality with clear inputs and outputs.  These could be:

* **UI elements:** Buttons, forms, navigation bars, modals, data tables – anything visually distinct with specific user interactions.
* **Data management modules:**  Functions or classes handling data fetching (API calls), data transformation, and data storage (local storage, database interactions). These are often independent of the UI.
* **Business logic components:** Functions or classes encapsulating specific business rules or calculations. For example, a component calculating a total price based on items in a shopping cart.
* **Utility functions:**  Reusable helper functions performing common tasks like validation, formatting, or string manipulation.


**Identify components based on:**

* **Functionality:** Does a section of your code perform a distinct, well-defined task?
* **Reusability:** Could this code be used in multiple places within your project or even in different projects?
* **Independence:**  Does it operate largely independent of other parts of the application, only interacting through well-defined interfaces (inputs/outputs)?

**2. Implementing a Simple Reusable Component Today:**

Let's illustrate with a simple JavaScript example for a reusable button component:

```javascript
// Reusable button component
function createButton(text, onClick) {
  const button = document.createElement('button');
  button.textContent = text;
  button.addEventListener('click', onClick);
  return button;
}

// Usage:
const myButton = createButton('Click Me!', () => {
  alert('Button clicked!');
});
document.body.appendChild(myButton);


const anotherButton = createButton('Another Button', () => {
    console.log("Another button clicked!");
});
document.body.appendChild(anotherButton);
```

This `createButton` function takes the button text and a click handler function as input, creating and returning a button element.  This is a basic example; more complex components might involve more sophisticated DOM manipulation and state management.  Adapt this approach based on your project's technology (React, Angular, Vue, plain JavaScript, etc.).  The key is to encapsulate the component's logic and rendering within a function or class.

**3. When to Use Pre-built Components (e.g., React Bootstrap):**

Using pre-built components like those from React Bootstrap is most beneficial when:

* **Time constraints are tight:** You can save significant development time by leveraging ready-made, tested components.
* **Consistency is crucial:**  Pre-built components often adhere to established design patterns and ensure visual consistency across your application.
* **Specialized functionality is needed:**  Libraries provide components for complex interactions (e.g., date pickers, auto-complete, rich text editors) that would require substantial effort to build from scratch.
* **Maintenance is a priority:**  Using well-maintained libraries reduces your maintenance burden because bug fixes and updates are handled by the library maintainers.


However, be mindful of potential drawbacks:  dependencies might increase project size and complexity, and you might lose some customization flexibility.


**4. Simple Test for Component Reusability and Independence:**

A simple test is to try using the component in a different part of your application or even a separate, small test project.  If it works seamlessly without requiring significant modifications, it's a strong indicator of reusability and independence.  Specifically:

1. **Isolate the component:** Extract the component's code into a separate file or module.
2. **Create a simple test environment:**  This could be a new HTML file, a simple React app, or whatever framework your project uses.
3. **Integrate the component:**  Import or include the component in your test environment and try using it.
4. **Observe behavior:** Does it function correctly without requiring changes to the code itself or its dependencies?  If yes, it’s likely reusable and independent.  If not, it suggests the component is tightly coupled with other parts of your application and needs refactoring.


**5. Google's Android vs. Yahoo!'s Early 2000s Approach:**

Google's approach to component-based development in Android heavily influenced its rapid feature iteration. Android's modular design, with well-defined interfaces between components, allowed for parallel development and independent updates.  Teams could work on different parts of the system simultaneously without causing conflicts, enabling faster release cycles and quicker adoption of new features.

Yahoo! in the early 2000s, on the other hand, often lacked a cohesive component-based architecture.  This led to a monolithic codebase that was difficult to maintain, update, and extend.  Adding new features was slow and prone to errors due to the tight coupling of different parts of the system.  Changes in one area frequently caused unforeseen consequences in others, hindering rapid feature iteration and ultimately contributing to their struggles in keeping up with competitors who had adopted more modular approaches.  This demonstrates the pitfalls of neglecting component-based principles: increased development time, higher maintenance costs, reduced flexibility, and slower feature development.
