Let's address your questions about implementing effective logging strategies.

**1. Three Most Basic Log Types to Implement Immediately:**

You should prioritize these three log types for almost any project:

* **Error Logs:** Record any exceptions, errors, or unexpected behavior that prevents the application from functioning correctly.  These are crucial for debugging and identifying critical issues.  They should include as much context as possible (e.g., stack trace, relevant data).
* **Info Logs:**  Provide high-level information about the application's workflow and state.  These help you track the general progress of the application and understand its behavior under normal conditions. Think of significant milestones or events.
* **Warning Logs:**  Signal potential problems or situations that might lead to errors in the future.  For instance, a low disk space warning, a database connection timeout warning, or a configuration file being read with inconsistencies. These aren't critical errors yet, but they warrant attention.


**2. Quickly Setting Up Basic Logging:**

The approach varies depending on your language/framework. Here are some quick starts:

* **Python (with `logging` module):**

```python
import logging

logging.basicConfig(filename='my_app.log', level=logging.INFO, 
                    format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')

logging.info('Application started successfully.')
logging.warning('Low disk space detected.')
logging.error('Database connection failed: %s', 'Connection refused') 
```

* **JavaScript (Node.js with `winston`):**

```javascript
const winston = require('winston');

const logger = winston.createLogger({
  level: 'info',
  format: winston.format.json(),
  transports: [
    new winston.transports.File({ filename: 'error.log', level: 'error' }),
    new winston.transports.File({ filename: 'combined.log' }),
  ],
});

logger.info('Application started');
logger.warn('Potential issue detected');
logger.error('Critical error occurred!');

```

* **Java (with `java.util.logging`):**

```java
import java.util.logging.Level;
import java.util.logging.Logger;

public class Main {
    private static final Logger LOGGER = Logger.getLogger(Main.class.getName());

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LOGGER.log(Level.INFO, "Application started");
        LOGGER.log(Level.WARNING, "Low disk space detected");
        LOGGER.log(Level.SEVERE, "Database connection failed", new Exception("Connection error"));
    }
}
```

These examples demonstrate basic setup; you'll likely need to configure more robust logging for production environments (e.g., using structured logging, logging to a centralized system like Elasticsearch or Splunk).

**3. Logging Levels in a Simple Web Application:**

* **DEBUG:**  Extremely detailed information useful for developers during debugging.  Generally, these should be turned off in production unless you're actively investigating an issue.  Example:  "User logged in with username 'john_doe' and password hash '...'."  (Password hash should be masked for security.)
* **INFO:**  Record significant events in the application's normal workflow. Example: "User successfully placed an order," "Payment processed successfully."
* **WARNING:**  Potential problems that might lead to errors. Example:  "Out of stock warning for product X,"  "User attempted login with incorrect credentials (3rd attempt)."
* **ERROR:**  Actual errors that prevent the application from functioning correctly.  Example: "Database connection failed," "Internal server error (500)," "Exception caught during order processing."


**4. Verifying Log Recordings:**

* **Check the log file(s):**  The simplest way is to look at the designated log file(s) using a text editor or a dedicated log viewer.  Ensure the logs are being written to the correct location and contain the expected information.
* **Use a logging viewer:** Tools like the `tail -f` command (Linux/macOS) let you monitor log files in real-time.
* **Include timestamps:**  Timestamps are crucial to ordering events and understanding the timeline of events leading up to an error.


**5. Google's Logging Strategy:**

Google's success is partly attributed to its sophisticated logging and monitoring systems.  They use a highly distributed and scalable system to track massive amounts of data related to user queries, search results, server performance, and more.  This allows them to:

* **Analyze user behavior:** Understand search patterns, popular queries, and areas for improvement in their algorithms.
* **Identify and fix bugs quickly:**  Detect performance bottlenecks and errors affecting the search engine.
* **Improve the search algorithm:**   Use log data to constantly refine the ranking algorithms and provide more relevant results.
* **Monitor system health:** Track server performance and capacity to ensure scalability and availability.

The scale and sophistication of Google's logging are beyond most applications, but the core principle of comprehensive logging for analysis, debugging, and improvement is essential.


**6. Yahoo! Security Breach (Bad Example):**

While the exact details of specific Yahoo! breaches and their relation to inadequate logging are often confidential and not publicly fully disclosed, inadequate logging practices are commonly cited as a contributing factor to many data breaches.  Insufficient logging makes it difficult to:

* **Detect intrusions early:**  Lack of detailed logs makes it hard to identify malicious activity such as unauthorized access or data exfiltration.
* **Trace the attack:**  Without comprehensive logs, reconstructing the attack timeline and identifying the attacker becomes significantly more difficult.
* **Determine the extent of the damage:**  Limited logging makes it hard to assess the impact of the breach, identifying compromised accounts or data.

In short, insufficient logging hampers incident response and makes it more challenging to prevent future attacks.  It's crucial to log key events, including user actions, system access, and security-related events, with sufficient detail to facilitate investigation and remediation in the event of a breach.
