1. Analyzing social media posts to understand customer sentiment.

2. Using Python's `multiprocessing` library to parallelize a word count task.

3. When dealing with massive datasets exceeding the capacity of a single machine, requiring high availability and fault tolerance.

4. Data processing speed, storage costs, query latency, and accuracy of insights.

5. By using distributed processing to index and rank web pages more efficiently and accurately, incorporating user search behavior.

6. Inability to handle increased data volume and user traffic, leading to system crashes and service disruptions (e.g., Amazon's S3 outage in 2017).

7. Use Spark to perform aggregations and transformations on the transaction data to identify trends, popular products, and customer segments.

8. Choosing a technology unsuitable for the data volume, velocity, or variety, leading to performance bottlenecks and project delays (e.g., Yahoo!'s Hadoop adoption challenges).
