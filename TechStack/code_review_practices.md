Let's address each question about code review practices:

**1. What are the three most important things to look for in a code review?**

The three most important things to focus on during a code review are:

* **Correctness:** Does the code achieve its intended purpose without bugs or unexpected behavior?  This involves checking for logical errors, boundary conditions, and potential exceptions.
* **Security:**  Does the code introduce any security vulnerabilities? Look for issues like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and insecure handling of sensitive data.
* **Readability & Maintainability:** Is the code easy to understand, modify, and maintain in the future? This includes checking for consistent coding style, meaningful variable names, sufficient comments (where needed), and well-structured code.  Poor readability significantly impacts long-term project success.

While other aspects like performance are important, these three directly impact the stability, security, and longevity of the software.


**2. How do I provide constructive feedback during a code review?**

Constructive feedback focuses on the code, not the person.  Follow these guidelines:

* **Be specific:** Instead of "This code is messy," say "Lines 25-30 are difficult to follow because the indentation is inconsistent and the variable names aren't descriptive enough.  Consider renaming `x` to `customerID` and adding a comment explaining the purpose of the loop."
* **Focus on one or two key issues:**  Don't overwhelm the author with a long list of minor nitpicks. Prioritize the most important concerns.
* **Suggest solutions:** Don't just point out problems; propose alternative solutions where possible.
* **Use a polite and respectful tone:** Even when pointing out significant flaws, maintain a professional and collaborative attitude.
* **Ask questions:** If you're unsure about something, ask clarifying questions instead of making assumptions.
* **Use a code review tool:** Many tools allow for inline comments, making feedback easier to provide and understand.


**3. When is the best time to conduct a code review in a sprint?**

Ideally, code reviews should happen *early* in the sprint, ideally *before* code is integrated into the main branch.  This allows for early detection and correction of errors, reducing the risk of major issues later in the sprint and preventing integration problems.  Aim for a review before the code is considered "done" but after it's reached a point of functional completeness.


**4. What tools can I use to simplify the code review process?**

Many tools streamline code reviews:

* **GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket:** These platforms have built-in code review features, including pull requests and inline commenting.
* **Crucible, Review Board:** Dedicated code review tools offer more advanced features like automated checks and reporting.
* **Code Climate, SonarQube:** Static analysis tools automatically detect potential bugs, security vulnerabilities, and style issues.  These can significantly augment manual review.


**5. How can I effectively communicate my concerns about code quality?**

Use clear, concise language.  Focus on the impact of the issue, not just the issue itself.  For example:

* **Instead of:** "This function is too long."
* **Say:** "This function is over 100 lines long, making it difficult to understand and maintain.  Splitting it into smaller, more focused functions would improve readability and testability."

Back up your concerns with evidence (e.g., specific lines of code, test results, performance metrics).


**6. What is a typical use case for code review in a web application development project?**

Code reviews are crucial throughout the entire web application development lifecycle.  Common use cases include:

* **Validating functionality:** Ensuring the code meets the specified requirements.
* **Identifying security vulnerabilities:** Preventing attacks like SQL injection or XSS.
* **Improving code quality:** Enhancing readability, maintainability, and performance.
* **Knowledge sharing:**  Facilitating collaboration and knowledge transfer among team members.
* **Preventing bugs:** Catching errors early in the development process.


**7. How can I validate that the code changes meet the requirements after a review?**

After a review, the code should undergo rigorous testing:

* **Unit tests:** Verify individual components function correctly.
* **Integration tests:** Ensure components work together seamlessly.
* **System tests (end-to-end tests):** Validate the entire application meets the requirements.
* **User acceptance testing (UAT):**  Get feedback from real users to ensure the application meets their needs.


**8. What is a good example of code review practices from Google's history?**

Google is known for its emphasis on code reviews as an integral part of its engineering culture. They've built robust systems to facilitate reviews (like their internal code review tools), promoting thoroughness and collaboration.  Their emphasis on readability, maintainability, and automated testing are directly linked to their rigorous code review processes.  They prioritize catching errors early, fostering a culture of learning, and preventing regressions.


**9. How can I prevent code review from becoming a bottleneck?**

* **Keep reviews focused:**  Don't review massive code changes all at once. Break them into smaller, more manageable chunks.
* **Set reasonable review times:**  Establish clear expectations for how long a review should take.
* **Use automated checks:** Leverage static analysis tools to automate some aspects of the review process.
* **Train developers in good coding practices:**  Reduce the number of issues that need to be addressed during reviews.
* **Prioritize reviews:** Focus on reviewing critical code first.
* **Limit the number of reviewers:**  Too many reviewers can slow down the process.  Often, two or three reviewers are sufficient.


**10. What is a bad example of code review practices from the history of Microsoft?**

While Microsoft has evolved its practices, in earlier periods, there have been accounts suggesting a lack of emphasis on thorough code review in some projects. This resulted in the accumulation of technical debt, the emergence of difficult-to-maintain codebases, and potentially security vulnerabilities. The absence of systematic and enforced code review practices negatively impacted the long-term health of some of their software projects.


**11. When should I escalate a code review concern to a senior developer or manager?**

Escalate when:

* **You can't resolve the issue with the code author:**  If the author is unwilling or unable to address critical concerns.
* **The issue is serious:**  If the code has significant security implications, performance bottlenecks, or violates critical architectural principles.
* **You lack the expertise to address the issue:** If you need help understanding a complex piece of code.
* **You suspect a pattern of poor coding practices:** If the same issues repeatedly appear in the code author's work.


**12. How can I integrate automated checks into my code review workflow?**

Use static analysis tools like SonarQube, Code Climate, or ESLint (for JavaScript). These tools can be integrated into your CI/CD pipeline.  Before a pull request is even mergeable, these tools can automatically check for:

* **Coding style violations:**  Ensuring consistent formatting and adherence to coding standards.
* **Potential bugs:**  Identifying common programming errors.
* **Security vulnerabilities:** Detecting potential security risks.
* **Code complexity:**  Flagging areas of excessive complexity.

The results of these automated checks can be displayed directly within your code review tool, streamlining the review process and catching many issues before a human reviewer even looks at the code.
