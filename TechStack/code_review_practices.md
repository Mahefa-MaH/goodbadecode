## Answering your Code Review Questions:

**1. What is the most basic goal of a code review?**

The most basic goal of a code review is to improve code quality. This encompasses correctness, readability, maintainability, security, and adherence to coding standards.  It's about catching bugs early, preventing future problems, and fostering knowledge sharing within the team.

**2. How do I prepare my code for a review?**

* **Self-review:** Before submitting, thoroughly test your code and identify potential issues yourself.
* **Clear commit message:**  Write a concise, informative commit message explaining the changes and their purpose.
* **Modularization:** Break down large changes into smaller, logical commits for easier review.
* **Formatting and Style:** Ensure your code adheres to team coding standards (e.g., consistent indentation, naming conventions).
* **Documentation:** Add comments where necessary to clarify complex logic or non-obvious functionality.
* **Testing:** Include unit tests (and integration tests where relevant) demonstrating the correctness of your changes.


**3. When is the best time to conduct a code review?**

Ideally, code reviews should happen *before* the code is merged into the main branch.  The sooner a problem is caught, the cheaper and easier it is to fix.  Don't wait until the end of a sprint or a project deadline.  Frequent, smaller reviews are better than infrequent, large ones.

**4. What are three things I should always check during a code review?**

* **Correctness:** Does the code work as intended?  Are there any bugs or edge cases not handled properly?
* **Readability:** Is the code easy to understand and follow?  Are variable and function names clear and descriptive? Is the code well-structured?
* **Security:** Are there any potential security vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting)?

**5. How can I give constructive feedback during a code review?**

* **Focus on the code, not the person:** Avoid personal attacks or blaming language. Frame comments as suggestions rather than criticisms.
* **Be specific:**  Instead of saying "This is messy," say "Lines 25-30 could be improved by refactoring this section into a separate function."
* **Provide context:** Explain why a change is needed and what the potential consequences of not making the change might be.
* **Use a consistent tone:**  Maintain a professional and respectful demeanor throughout the review.
* **Offer solutions:** Don't just point out problems; suggest ways to improve the code.

**6. When should I reject a code change during a review?**

Reject a code change if:

* **It contains critical bugs or security vulnerabilities:** The code is demonstrably broken or poses a significant risk.
* **It violates coding standards:** The code is poorly written, unreadable, or doesn't meet the team's style guidelines.
* **It doesn't meet the requirements:** The code doesn't fulfill its intended purpose or doesn't address the problem it's supposed to solve.
* **It introduces technical debt:** The changes create unnecessary complexity or make future modifications more difficult.

**7. What is a typical workflow for a code review in your team?** (This will vary greatly depending on the team)

There's no single "typical" workflow, but a common pattern involves:

1. Developer submits a pull request (PR) on a platform like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.
2. The PR is assigned to one or more reviewers.
3. Reviewers examine the code, provide feedback, and request changes.
4. The developer addresses the feedback and may resubmit the PR.
5. Once the reviewers are satisfied, the PR is approved and merged.

**8. How can I validate that the code changes after the review meet the requirements?**

After addressing review comments, run thorough tests (unit, integration, system, etc.).  Verify the code meets the original requirements and acceptance criteria defined before development.  Consider adding end-to-end tests to ensure all components work together as expected.

**9. What was a good example of a code review process at Google, improving a specific product?** (This requires anecdotal evidence, as internal Google processes aren't publicly detailed)

I cannot provide a specific, verifiable example of a Google code review leading to a product improvement due to the confidential nature of such information. However, it's widely known that Google employs rigorous code review processes across its products, emphasizing quality and scalability.  The improvements would likely be incremental and spread throughout the codebase, rather than tied to a single, easily-identifiable event.

**10. How would you describe a hypothetical bad code review process at Amazon, leading to a significant incident?**

A hypothetical scenario:  Imagine Amazon's order processing system.  Due to rushed deadlines and insufficient code reviews, a crucial change introducing a concurrency bug slips through. This bug causes a massive data corruption event affecting millions of orders, resulting in significant financial losses, reputational damage, and customer frustration. The incident highlights the lack of rigorous code review, automated testing, and sufficient oversight within the development process.

**11. What tools can simplify the code review process?**

* **GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket:**  These platforms provide integrated code review functionalities, including pull requests, commenting, and change tracking.
* **Crucible, Gerrit:**  Dedicated code review tools offering advanced features such as pre-commit hooks and detailed reporting.
* **Linters and Static Analyzers:** Tools like ESLint (JavaScript), Pylint (Python), and SonarQube automatically identify coding style issues and potential bugs before review.

**12. When should I escalate a code review issue beyond my immediate team?**

Escalate when:

* **The issue is a serious security vulnerability:**  Requires immediate attention from security specialists.
* **The issue involves a critical system component:** Impacts multiple teams or the entire product.
* **The issue cannot be resolved within the team:** Requires expertise or resources outside the team's capabilities.
* **The team disagrees on how to resolve the issue:** Needs mediation or a higher-level decision.


Remember, code reviews are a crucial part of software development.  By following best practices and utilizing the right tools, you can make the process more efficient and effective, ultimately leading to higher-quality software.
