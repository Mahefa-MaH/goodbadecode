**Title:** Ruby API JSON: Secure vs. Insecure Data Fetching

**Summary:**  The good example demonstrates robust error handling and secure data processing when fetching JSON from an API, unlike the bad example, which is vulnerable to exceptions and potential security issues.

**Good Code:**

```ruby
require 'net/http'
require 'json'

def fetch_json_securely(url)
  uri = URI(url)
  response = Net::HTTP.get_response(uri)

  case response
  when Net::HTTPSuccess
    begin
      JSON.parse(response.body)
    rescue JSON::ParserError => e
      puts "Error parsing JSON: #{e.message}"
      return nil # or raise a custom exception
    end
  else
    puts "API request failed with status code: #{response.code}"
    return nil # or raise a custom exception,  consider logging the error for debugging.
  end
end

url = "https://api.example.com/data" # Replace with your API endpoint
data = fetch_json_securely(url)

if data
  puts "Successfully fetched data: #{data}"
end

```

**Bad Code:**

```ruby
require 'net/http'
require 'json'

def fetch_json_insecurely(url)
  JSON.parse(Net::HTTP.get(URI(url)))
end

url = "https://api.example.com/data" # Replace with your API endpoint
data = fetch_json_insecurely(url)
puts data
```


**Key Takeaways:**

* **Error Handling:** The good code explicitly handles potential `Net::HTTP` errors (e.g., network issues, non-2xx status codes) and `JSON::ParserError` exceptions, preventing application crashes and providing informative error messages.  The bad code lacks error handling, leading to potential crashes if the API is unavailable or returns invalid JSON.
* **Security:** The good code implicitly handles potential security issues through the use of the `Net::HTTP` library which adheres to secure HTTP practices and doesn't directly expose the application to potential vulnerabilities.  The bad code lacks explicit security checks.
* **Readability and Maintainability:** The good code is more organized and easier to understand due to its clear structure and use of `case` statements for handling different response types.  The bad code is concise but lacks clarity and robustness.
* **Robustness:** The good code returns `nil` (or could raise a custom exception) on error, allowing the calling code to gracefully handle failures. The bad code will crash if there's any problem.
