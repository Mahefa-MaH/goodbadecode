**Title:** Efficient Erlang Process Management: Good vs. Bad Practices

**Summary:**  The key difference lies in handling process creation and supervision: good Erlang code leverages the OTP framework for robust error handling and process management, while bad code uses direct process creation and lacks proper supervision, leading to instability and difficulty in debugging.


**Good Code:**

```erlang
-module(good_example).
-export([start/0, handle/1]).

start() ->
    Supervisor = supervisor:start_link({local, my_sup}, ?MODULE, []),
    {ok, Supervisor}.

init(State) ->
    {ok, State}.

handle({new_request, Data}, State) ->
    Pid = spawn_link(fun() -> worker(Data) end),
    {noreply, State};
handle(Other, State) ->
    {noreply, State}.

worker(Data) ->
    try
        % Perform some work with Data
        io:format("Processing: ~p~n", [Data]),
        ok
    catch
        _:_ ->
            exit(error)
    end.

% Supervisor Specification
?MODULE
    ->
        {supervisor,
         {local, my_sup},
         {1, {one_for_one, 10, 10}},
         [{worker, {global, worker}, [good_example, handle], []}]
        }.

```

**Bad Code:**

```erlang
-module(bad_example).
-export([start/0, handle/1]).

start() ->
    spawn(fun() -> loop() end).

loop() ->
    receive
        {new_request, Data} ->
            try
                %Perform some work with Data
                io:format("Processing: ~p~n", [Data])
            catch
                _:_ ->
                    % No proper error handling. Process simply crashes
                    exit(crash)
            end,
            loop()
        ;
        _ ->
            loop()
    end.
```


**Key Takeaways:**

* **Supervision:** The good code uses the OTP `supervisor` to monitor and restart the worker processes, ensuring system resilience in case of errors.  The bad code lacks any supervision, meaning a single process crash can bring down the entire system.
* **Error Handling:** The good code uses `try...catch` blocks within the worker process and leverages `spawn_link` to allow the supervisor to detect failures. The bad code has inadequate error handling within the `loop` function.  Process crashes silently and aren't handled gracefully.
* **Process Management:** The good code uses `spawn_link` to create linked processes, making it possible for the supervisor to monitor their status. The bad code uses `spawn`, which offers no such monitoring capabilities.
* **Maintainability:** The structured approach of the good code using the OTP framework makes it much easier to maintain, extend, and debug compared to the unstructured approach of the bad code.
* **Scalability:**  The supervised model of the good code scales much better as the number of workers increases, as the supervisor manages their lifecycle effectively. The bad code becomes increasingly difficult to manage and monitor at scale.
