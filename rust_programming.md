**Title:** Rust Ownership: Safe vs. Unsafe Code Comparison

**Summary:**  Rust's ownership system prevents memory unsafety through compile-time checks.  Unsafe code blocks disable these checks, offering fine-grained control but requiring extreme care to avoid undefined behavior and memory leaks.


**Good Code (Safe Rust):**

```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");  // s1 owns the string data
    let s2 = s1;                    // s1's ownership moves to s2; s1 is invalidated

    // println!("{}", s1); // This would cause a compile-time error!

    let s3 = s2.clone();  // s3 creates a deep copy; both s2 and s3 own their data

    println!("s2: {}, s3: {}", s2, s3); 
}
```


**Bad Code (Unsafe Rust - with potential memory leak):**

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s1 = String::from("hello");
    let ptr = s1.as_mut_ptr();  // Get a raw pointer. No ownership transfer!
    let len = s1.len();
    std::mem::forget(s1); // Prevents s1 from being dropped, creating a leak.


    unsafe {
        let s2 = String::from_raw_parts(ptr, len, len); // Reconstruct string from raw pointer
        println!("{}", s2); // Might work, might segfault, might cause a memory leak...
    }
}
```


**Key Takeaways:**

* **Memory Safety:** Good code leverages Rust's ownership and borrowing system, guaranteeing memory safety at compile time. Bad code uses `unsafe` blocks, bypassing these checks and increasing the risk of undefined behavior, crashes, and memory leaks.
* **Data Races:**  Good code inherently prevents data races because ownership ensures only one mutable reference exists at any time.  Unsafe code requires careful manual management to avoid data races, a major source of concurrency bugs.
* **Maintainability:** Good code is easier to read, understand, and maintain due to its explicit ownership and borrowing rules.  Unsafe code is harder to audit and reason about, leading to increased complexity and potential errors.
* **Compile-Time Errors:** The compiler catches errors in safe code, preventing runtime surprises.  Unsafe code often defers errors to runtime, making debugging significantly more difficult.
* **Code Clarity:** Safe Rust code is clearer, reflecting the programmer's intentions more effectively. Unsafe code might be obfuscated because it is doing things the compiler normally prevents.


**Note:**  The "Bad Code" example is a simplified demonstration of potential problems. Real-world unsafe code scenarios are often far more intricate and dangerous.  Use `unsafe` only when absolutely necessary and with a thorough understanding of its implications.
