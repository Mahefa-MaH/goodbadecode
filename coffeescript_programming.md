**Title:** CoffeeScript: Concise vs. Verbose Function Definitions

**Summary:**  CoffeeScript's implicit function return simplifies code, unlike JavaScript's explicit `return` statements.  Ignoring this difference leads to unexpected behavior and less readable code.


**Good Code:**

```coffeescript
# Concise and efficient CoffeeScript function definition
square = (x) -> x * x

# Function with multiple statements; implicit return of last expression
max = (a, b) ->
  if a > b then a else b

# Example usage
console.log square(5) # Output: 25
console.log max(10, 5) # Output: 10
```

**Bad Code:**

```coffeescript
# Verbose and inefficient - mimicking JavaScript style unnecessarily
square = (x) ->
  result = x * x
  return result

max = (a, b) ->
  if a > b
    return a
  else
    return b

console.log square(5)
console.log max(10, 5)
```


**Key Takeaways:**

* **Readability:** The good code is significantly more concise and easier to read, reflecting CoffeeScript's philosophy of brevity.
* **Efficiency:**  The implicit return avoids unnecessary variable assignments and `return` statements, leading to smaller and potentially faster code (though the difference is often negligible).
* **Idiomatic CoffeeScript:**  The good code utilizes CoffeeScript's features effectively, making it more consistent with the language's style and best practices.
* **Reduced Errors:** Explicit `return` statements in CoffeeScript, as shown in the bad example, increase the potential for errors, such as forgetting a `return` or accidentally returning the wrong value.  The implicit return simplifies logic and minimizes these risks.
* **Maintainability:** Cleaner code is easier to understand and maintain, particularly in larger projects.  The good code is far easier to debug and modify.
