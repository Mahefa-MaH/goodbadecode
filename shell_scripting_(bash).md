**Title:** Secure & Efficient JSON Parsing in Bash

**Summary:**  The good example uses a robust, secure method for JSON parsing avoiding command injection vulnerabilities, while the bad example is vulnerable and relies on potentially unsafe external tools.

**Good Code:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Using jq for safe and efficient JSON parsing

url="https://api.example.com/data"
response=$(curl -s "$url")

if [[ $? -ne 0 ]]; then
  echo "Error fetching data from URL: $url"
  exit 1
fi


data=$(jq -r '.results[]' <<< "$response")

if [[ $? -ne 0 ]]; then
  echo "Error parsing JSON response"
  exit 1
fi

echo "$data" # Process the extracted data

```

**Bad Code:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash

#Insecure and inefficient JSON parsing, prone to command injection.  Avoid this!

url="https://api.example.com/data"
response=$(curl -s "$url")

# VULNERABLE TO COMMAND INJECTION IF response CONTAINS MALICIOUS DATA
eval "data=$(echo $response | python -c 'import json,sys; print json.load(sys.stdin)["results"]')"


echo "$data" # Process the extracted data (if it even works)
```


**Key Takeaways:**

* **Security:** The "good" code avoids command injection vulnerabilities by using `jq`, a dedicated JSON processor, which prevents malicious data in the API response from executing arbitrary commands. The "bad" code uses `eval` with user-supplied data, a major security risk.
* **Error Handling:**  The "good" code explicitly checks the return codes of `curl` and `jq` to handle potential errors (network issues, invalid JSON).  The "bad" code lacks error handling, leading to cryptic failures and potential crashes.
* **Efficiency:** `jq` is optimized for JSON processing, making it more efficient than using general-purpose tools like `python` within `eval`  for this specific task.
* **Readability and Maintainability:** The good code is more readable, easier to understand, and simpler to maintain due to its clear structure and explicit error handling.  The bad code is concise but cryptic and difficult to debug.
* **Portability:** `jq` is widely available on most Linux/macOS systems, making the good code more portable than relying on specific Python installations or other tools that might not be present on all systems.
