**Title:** Zig vs. C: Memory Management Strategies

**Summary:** Zig's compile-time memory management and built-in error handling offer significant safety and performance advantages over C's manual memory management, which is prone to errors like leaks and dangling pointers.  Zig's stricter type system also improves code clarity and maintainability.


**Good Code (Zig):**

```zig
const std = @import("std");

pub fn main() !void {
    var allocator = std.heap.GeneralPurposeAllocator(.{}){};
    defer allocator.deinit();
    const gpa = allocator.allocator();

    // Allocate memory on the heap, ensuring it's freed when it goes out of scope.
    var buffer = try gpa.alloc(u8, 1024);
    defer gpa.free(buffer);

    // ... use buffer ...

    std.debug.print("Memory allocated and freed safely!\n", .{});
}
```

**Bad Code (C):**

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
    char *buffer = (char *)malloc(1024); // Memory allocation without error checking
    if (buffer == NULL) {
      return 1;
    }
    // ... use buffer ...
    // Memory leak!  No free() call.
    return 0;
}
```


**Key Takeaways:**

* **Error Handling:** Zig's `try` keyword handles allocation errors gracefully, preventing crashes. C requires manual error checking (often omitted, leading to vulnerabilities).
* **Automatic Memory Management (RAII):** Zig's `defer` statement ensures automatic deallocation, preventing memory leaks. C relies on the programmer to explicitly call `free()`, a frequent source of errors.
* **Type Safety:** Zig's stricter type system catches errors at compile time, improving code reliability. C's looser typing can lead to runtime errors.
* **Memory Safety:** Zig's approach minimizes the risk of dangling pointers and buffer overflows, common vulnerabilities in C.
* **Readability and Maintainability:** Zig's code is arguably more concise and easier to understand due to its improved error handling and memory management features.  The `defer` statement clearly shows the resource cleanup intent.


This example highlights the core differences.  Zig's design choices directly address many of the common pitfalls and vulnerabilities associated with manual memory management in C.  While C offers ultimate control, Zig prioritizes safety and ease of development without sacrificing performance significantly.
