**Title:** Efficient String Manipulation in Zig vs. C

**Summary:**  Zig's built-in string type offers memory safety and compile-time guarantees absent in C's char arrays, leading to more robust and easier-to-maintain string handling.  Zig's allocator management simplifies memory control compared to C's manual memory allocation.

**Good Code (Zig):**

```zig
const std = @import("std");

pub fn main() !void {
    var gpa = std.heap.GeneralPurposeAllocator(.{}){};
    defer _ = gpa.deinit();
    const allocator = gpa.allocator();

    var name = try allocator.alloc(u8, 10);
    defer allocator.free(name);
    name[0..5] = "Hello";

    const greeting = try std.fmt.allocPrint(allocator, "{}, world!", .{name[0..5]});
    defer allocator.free(greeting);
    std.debug.print("{s}\n", .{greeting});
}
```

**Bad Code (C):**

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
    char *name = (char *)malloc(10 * sizeof(char)); 
    if (name == NULL) return 1; //Error Handling - minimal

    strncpy(name, "Hello", 5); //No null termination check. Potential Buffer overflow
    
    char *greeting = (char *)malloc(20 * sizeof(char));
    if (greeting == NULL) {free(name); return 1;} //Error Handling - improved (somewhat)

    sprintf(greeting, "%s, world!", name); //Potential buffer overflow if name is longer than expected. No bounds checking

    printf("%s\n", greeting);
    free(name);
    free(greeting);
    return 0;
}
```


**Key Takeaways:**

* **Memory Safety:** Zig's `allocator.alloc` and automatic freeing via `defer` prevent memory leaks and dangling pointers, common issues in C's manual memory management.  The C code requires explicit `free` calls and has inadequate error handling.
* **Compile-Time Safety:** Zig's type system catches errors related to string lengths and bounds at compile time.  The C code relies on runtime checks (that are incomplete), making it vulnerable to buffer overflows.
* **Ease of Use:** Zig's concise syntax and built-in string handling make string manipulation simpler and less error-prone than C's manual memory management and string functions.  The C code is less readable and requires more careful attention to memory and buffer management to prevent errors.
* **Error Handling:** Zig's `try` simplifies error handling, while the C code lacks robust error checking for `malloc` failures and potential buffer overflows.  A better C solution would involve more extensive checks and likely use `snprintf`.
* **Allocator Management:** Zig's `defer` statement automatically deallocates memory when the scope ends, while C requires manual `free` calls, which can be easily missed (causing leaks) or called prematurely (causing errors).


The Zig example demonstrates a safer, cleaner and more efficient way to handle strings compared to the C example's manual memory management and vulnerable string functions.  While both achieve the same functionality, the differences in safety and ease-of-use are significant.
