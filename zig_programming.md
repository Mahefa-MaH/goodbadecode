**Title:** Zig vs. C: Memory Management Strategies

**Summary:**  Zig employs a stricter, more explicit memory management model compared to C, relying heavily on ownership and error handling to prevent memory leaks and undefined behavior. C, in contrast, places the burden of memory management primarily on the programmer, requiring manual allocation and deallocation.


**Good Code (Zig):**

```zig
const std = @import("std");

pub fn main() !void {
    var gpa = std.heap.GeneralPurposeAllocator(.{}){};
    defer _ = gpa.deinit();
    const allocator = gpa.allocator();

    var buffer = try allocator.alloc(u8, 1024); // Allocate memory on the heap
    defer allocator.free(buffer); // Automatically free when out of scope

    // ... use buffer ...

    std.debug.print("Memory allocated and freed safely!\n", .{});
}
```

**Bad Code (C):**

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
    char *buffer = (char *)malloc(1024); // Allocate memory

    // ... use buffer ...

    // Missing free() call!  Memory leak!
    return 0;
}
```

**Key Takeaways:**

* **Error Handling:** Zig's `try` keyword explicitly handles allocation errors, preventing crashes. C's `malloc` silently returns `NULL` on failure, requiring manual error checking.
* **Automatic Memory Management:** Zig's `defer` statement guarantees `allocator.free(buffer)` is called even if errors occur within the `main` function, preventing memory leaks.  C requires explicit `free()` calls, which are often forgotten, leading to memory leaks.
* **Explicit Ownership:** Zig's ownership system helps the compiler detect potential memory safety issues at compile time. C relies on the programmer to carefully manage memory manually, making it error-prone.
* **Readability and Maintainability:** Zig's approach leads to cleaner, more maintainable code by reducing the cognitive load associated with manual memory management. C's manual approach can make code harder to understand and debug, particularly in larger projects.
* **Safety:** Zig's built-in safety mechanisms significantly reduce the risk of common memory-related bugs (e.g., buffer overflows, dangling pointers, double frees) which are prevalent in C.
