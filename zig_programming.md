**Title:** Zig vs. C: Memory Management Comparison

**Summary:**  Zig's built-in memory management features, such as `allocator` parameters and compile-time error checking for memory safety, offer significant advantages over C's manual memory management, which is prone to errors like dangling pointers and memory leaks.  Zig prioritizes safety and clarity while C prioritizes performance and control at the cost of increased developer responsibility.


**Good Code (Zig):**

```zig
const std = @import("std");

pub fn main() !void {
    var gpa = std.heap.GeneralPurposeAllocator(.{}){};
    defer _ = gpa.deinit();
    const allocator = gpa.allocator();

    const num_elements = 10;
    var arr = try allocator.alloc(i32, num_elements);
    defer allocator.free(arr);

    for (0..num_elements) |i| {
        arr[i] = i * 2;
    }

    for (0..num_elements) |i| {
        std.debug.print("arr[{d}] = {d}\n", .{i, arr[i]});
    }
}
```

**Bad Code (C):**

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
    int num_elements = 10;
    int *arr = (int *)malloc(num_elements * sizeof(int)); 

    for (int i = 0; i < num_elements; i++) {
        arr[i] = i * 2;
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < num_elements; i++) {
        printf("arr[%d] = %d\n", i, arr[i]);
    }

    //free(arr); //Missing free!  Memory leak!
    return 0;
}
```


**Key Takeaways:**

* **Memory Safety:** Zig's `allocator` and `defer` statements enforce deterministic memory management, preventing memory leaks and dangling pointers which are common issues in C's manual approach.  The `defer` keyword ensures `allocator.free(arr)` is always called, even if errors occur.
* **Error Handling:** Zig's `try` keyword handles allocation errors explicitly, preventing program crashes due to failed memory allocation unlike C's `malloc` which returns NULL on failure requiring manual checks.
* **Readability and Maintainability:** Zig's code is more concise and easier to read due to its explicit memory management. The `defer` statement improves code clarity by making resource cleanup explicit and predictable.
* **Compile-time checks:** Zig's compiler performs more extensive checks during compilation, catching memory-related errors earlier than C, which only detects memory errors at runtime.  This improves development time and reduces the risk of runtime crashes.
* **Explicit Resource Management:** Zig forces the programmer to think about resource management at the time of allocation, making code more predictable and reducing the chance of leaks.


In essence, while C offers maximum control and potential performance gains, Zig prioritizes memory safety and developer productivity by offering a more structured approach to memory management resulting in more robust and maintainable code.  The trade-off is some slight performance overhead, often negligible in most applications.
