**Title:** Zig vs. C: Memory Management Contrast

**Summary:**  Zig's compile-time memory management and strong type system offer increased safety and performance compared to C's manual memory management, which is prone to errors like dangling pointers and memory leaks.  Zig's allocator model also provides more control and flexibility.

**Good Code (Zig):**

```zig
const std = @import("std");

pub fn main() !void {
    var gpa = std.heap.GeneralPurposeAllocator(.{}){};
    defer _ = gpa.deinit();
    const allocator = gpa.allocator();

    var buf = try allocator.alloc(u8, 10);
    defer allocator.free(buf);

    for (buf) |*b| {
        b.* = 0;
    }

    std.debug.print("Buffer initialized to zero: {any}\n", .{buf});
}
```

**Bad Code (C):**

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
    int *buf = (int *)malloc(10 * sizeof(int)); //Potential memory leak
    if (buf == NULL) return 1; //Error handling is minimal

    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        buf[i] = 0;
    }

    printf("Buffer initialized to zero.\n"); 
    //free(buf); //Missing free call!  This leads to a memory leak.
    return 0;
}
```

**Key Takeaways:**

* **Memory Safety:** Zig's `defer allocator.free(buf);` ensures memory is freed automatically, preventing memory leaks.  C requires manual `free()` calls, which are easily forgotten (as shown in the bad example).
* **Error Handling:**  The Zig code uses `try` to handle potential allocation failures gracefully.  The C code has rudimentary error handling.
* **Allocator Control:** Zig provides explicit control over memory allocation with its allocator system, allowing for fine-grained management and potentially improved performance. C's `malloc` is less flexible.
* **Type Safety:** Zig's type system helps prevent common C errors like pointer arithmetic mistakes and type mismatches.  The C code uses unsafe casting (`(int *)malloc`) that could lead to problems.
* **Readability:** Zig's `defer` statement enhances code readability by clearly indicating resource cleanup. C's approach requires remembering to call `free()` at the appropriate point, increasing the chance of error.


The Zig example showcases a safer and more robust approach to memory management. While C offers fine-grained control, this comes at the cost of increased responsibility and risk of errors that Zig mitigates through its design.
