**Title:** Zig vs. C: Memory Management Strategies Compared

**Summary:**  Zig's built-in memory safety features and compile-time error checking contrast sharply with C's manual memory management, making Zig safer but potentially less performant in specific low-level scenarios.  Zig's allocator model offers more control than C's `malloc`/`free`.


**Good Code (Zig):**

```zig
const std = @import("std");

pub fn main() !void {
    var gpa = std.heap.GeneralPurposeAllocator(.{}){};
    defer _ = gpa.deinit();
    const allocator = gpa.allocator();

    var buffer = try allocator.alloc(u8, 1024);
    defer allocator.free(buffer);

    // ... use buffer ...

    std.debug.print("Memory allocated and freed safely!\n", .{});
}
```

**Bad Code (C):**

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
    char *buffer = (char *)malloc(1024); 
    if (buffer == NULL) {
        perror("malloc failed");
        return 1;
    }

    // ... use buffer ...

    // Missing free() - memory leak!
    return 0; 
}
```

**Key Takeaways:**

* **Memory Safety:** Zig's allocator ensures memory is automatically freed when the `defer` statement executes, preventing memory leaks and dangling pointers.  C requires explicit `free()` calls, prone to programmer error.
* **Error Handling:** Zig uses the `try` keyword and `!void` return type to explicitly handle allocation errors, preventing crashes. C's `malloc` returns `NULL` on failure, requiring manual checks (often omitted).
* **Allocator Control:** Zig provides more control over memory allocation through various allocator types, allowing for fine-tuning of performance characteristics. C's `malloc`/`free` are less versatile.
* **Readability & Maintainability:** Zig's `defer` statement simplifies memory management, making the code clearer and easier to maintain. C's manual memory management can lead to complex and error-prone code.
* **Compile-Time Safety:** Zig's compiler can detect many memory errors at compile time, preventing runtime crashes. C relies mostly on runtime checks which are not always complete.


This comparison highlights the key differences in memory management philosophy between Zig and C. Zig prioritizes safety and ease of use, while C prioritizes maximum performance and low-level control, but at the cost of increased risk of memory-related bugs.
