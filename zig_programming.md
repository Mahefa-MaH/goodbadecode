**Title:** Zig vs. C: Memory Management Showdown

**Summary:**  Zig's compile-time memory management and built-in error handling offer improved safety and performance compared to C's manual memory management, which is prone to errors like segmentation faults and memory leaks.  Zig also boasts stronger type safety.


**Good Code (Zig):**

```zig
const std = @import("std");

pub fn main() !void {
    var arena = std.heap.ArenaAllocator.init(std.heap.page_allocator);
    defer arena.deinit();
    const allocator = arena.allocator();

    var buffer = try allocator.alloc(u8, 1024);
    defer allocator.free(buffer);

    // ... use buffer ...

    std.debug.print("Buffer used successfully!\n", .{});
}
```

**Bad Code (C):**

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
    char *buffer = (char *)malloc(1024); // No error checking!
    if (buffer == NULL) return 1; //Minimal error handling

    // ... use buffer ...

    free(buffer); //What if we forget this? Memory leak!
    printf("Buffer used successfully!\n");
    return 0;
}
```


**Key Takeaways:**

* **Error Handling:** Zig's `try` keyword forces error handling, preventing crashes from memory allocation failures.  The C code lacks robust error handling.
* **Memory Management:** Zig's `defer` statement ensures automatic memory deallocation, eliminating memory leaks. C requires manual memory management, making it prone to leaks if `free()` is omitted or called incorrectly.
* **Allocator Control:** Zig provides explicit allocator control. This improves performance, allowing for specialized allocators to be used for specific needs, and facilitates efficient memory management. C's `malloc` and `free` are less granular.
* **Type Safety:** Zig's stricter type system helps catch errors at compile time, reducing runtime surprises. C's weaker type system allows for more potential runtime errors.
* **Readability:** Zig's syntax is generally considered clearer and more modern, leading to more maintainable code.  The `defer` statement significantly enhances code clarity in memory management.
