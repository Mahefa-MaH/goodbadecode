**Title:** Zig vs. C: Memory Management Efficiency

**Summary:**  Zig's compile-time memory management and built-in error handling offer improved safety and performance compared to C's manual memory management, which is prone to errors like memory leaks and dangling pointers.  Zig's stricter type system further enhances code reliability.

**Good Code (Zig):**

```zig
const std = @import("std");

pub fn main() !void {
    var gpa = std.heap.GeneralPurposeAllocator(.{}){};
    defer _ = gpa.deinit();
    const allocator = gpa.allocator();

    var buf = try allocator.alloc(u8, 10);
    defer allocator.free(buf);

    for (buf) |*b, i| {
        b.* = @intCast(u8, i + 1);
    }

    std.debug.print("Buffer: ", .{});
    for (buf) |b| {
        std.debug.print("{d} ", .{b});
    }
    std.debug.print("\n", .{});
}
```

**Bad Code (C):**

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
    unsigned char *buf = (unsigned char *)malloc(10); //Memory allocation without error checking
    if (buf == NULL) {
        return 1;
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        buf[i] = i + 1;
    }

    printf("Buffer: ");
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        printf("%d ", buf[i]);
    }
    printf("\n");
    //free(buf); //Missing free, causing memory leak!
    return 0;
}
```


**Key Takeaways:**

* **Error Handling:** Zig's `try` keyword and `!` error handling mechanism forces the programmer to explicitly handle potential allocation failures, preventing runtime crashes.  The C code lacks robust error handling for `malloc`.
* **Memory Safety:** Zig's `defer allocator.free(buf);` ensures the memory allocated is automatically freed, even if errors occur, preventing memory leaks. The C code omits the `free()` call entirely, leading to a memory leak.
* **Allocator Management:** Zig's explicit allocator usage promotes better control and avoids potential issues from implicit global allocators.  C relies on a global allocator, which can be less efficient and harder to debug.
* **Type Safety:** Zig's type system helps prevent common C errors such as buffer overflows and pointer arithmetic mistakes.  While not directly demonstrated in this short example, Zig's stronger type system contributes to overall code safety and maintainability.
* **Readability:** Zig's syntax, while initially requiring a learning curve, often leads to more readable and maintainable code compared to the terseness that can sometimes lead to ambiguity in C.


Note:  Both code snippets perform the same basic task of allocating a buffer, populating it with values, and printing its contents.  The crucial difference lies in how they handle memory management and error handling.  The C example demonstrates common pitfalls that Zig avoids through its design.
