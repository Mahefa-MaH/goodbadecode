**Title:** Zig vs. C: Memory Management Efficiency

**Summary:**  Zig's built-in allocator and compile-time guarantees offer improved memory safety and performance compared to C's manual memory management, which is prone to errors like leaks and dangling pointers.  Zig's approach simplifies development while potentially improving runtime efficiency in specific scenarios.


**Good Code (Zig):**

```zig
const std = @import("std");

pub fn main() !void {
    var gpa = std.heap.GeneralPurposeAllocator(.{}){};
    defer _ = gpa.deinit();
    const allocator = gpa.allocator();

    var buffer = try allocator.alloc(u8, 1024); // Allocate memory
    defer allocator.free(buffer); // Guaranteed deallocation

    // ... use buffer ...

    std.debug.print("Memory allocated and freed safely!\n", .{});
}
```


**Bad Code (C):**

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
    char *buffer = (char *)malloc(1024); // Allocate memory

    // ... use buffer ...

    // Missing free() - memory leak!
    return 0; 
}
```


**Key Takeaways:**

* **Memory Safety:** Zig's `defer` statement guarantees that allocated memory is always freed, preventing memory leaks. C requires manual `free()` calls, which are easily forgotten leading to leaks.
* **Error Handling:** Zig's `try` operator handles allocation errors gracefully, preventing crashes.  C's `malloc` can return `NULL` requiring explicit error checks (often omitted).
* **Allocator Control:** Zig provides explicit control over memory allocation through allocators, allowing for fine-grained management and optimization. C relies on a single global allocator which can be less efficient.
* **Compile-Time Safety:** Zig's compiler can often detect memory management issues at compile time, preventing runtime errors that are common in C.  C relies on runtime checks, which can be less efficient and miss subtle bugs.
* **Readability and Maintainability:** Zig's approach leads to cleaner and more readable code, reducing the chance of errors. C's manual management can make code complex and difficult to understand, particularly for large projects.
