**Title:** Zig vs. C: Memory Management Contrast

**Summary:**  Zig's compile-time memory management, via `alloc` and `defer`, offers improved safety and performance predictability compared to C's manual memory handling with `malloc` and `free`, which is prone to leaks and dangling pointers.


**Good Code (Zig):**

```zig
const std = @import("std");

pub fn main() !void {
    var gpa = std.heap.GeneralPurposeAllocator(.{}){};
    defer _ = gpa.deinit();
    const allocator = gpa.allocator();

    var buffer = try allocator.alloc(u8, 1024);
    defer allocator.free(buffer);

    // ... use buffer ...

    std.debug.print("Memory safely managed!\n", .{});
}
```

**Bad Code (C):**

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
    char *buffer = malloc(1024); // Memory allocation
    if (buffer == NULL) {
        return 1; //Error handling (minimal)
    }

    // ... use buffer ...

    //free(buffer); // Missing free call - memory leak!
    printf("Memory (potentially) leaked!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

**Key Takeaways:**

* **Memory Safety:** Zig's `defer` statement automatically frees allocated memory, preventing memory leaks.  C requires manual `free` calls, which are easily forgotten, leading to leaks.
* **Error Handling:** The Zig example incorporates error handling (`try`) during allocation. The C example has minimal error handling, making it vulnerable to crashes if allocation fails.
* **Readability and Maintainability:** Zig's approach is cleaner and easier to understand, reducing the chance of errors related to memory management.  The explicit `defer` makes it clear when memory will be released.
* **Compile-Time Safety:** Zig's allocator and `defer` are checked at compile time in many cases, catching memory errors before runtime. C's manual memory management only catches errors at runtime, if at all.
* **Reduced Debugging Time:**  The automatic memory management in Zig drastically reduces the time spent debugging memory-related issues. C's manual approach necessitates painstaking memory tracking.
