**Title:** Zig vs. C: Memory Management Efficiency Comparison

**Summary:**  Zig's compile-time memory management and explicit ownership model offer superior memory safety and performance compared to C's manual memory management, which is prone to errors like dangling pointers and memory leaks.  Zig's approach reduces runtime overhead while enhancing security.


**Good Code (Zig):**

```zig
const std = @import("std");

pub fn main() !void {
    var gpa = std.heap.GeneralPurposeAllocator(.{}){};
    defer _ = gpa.deinit();
    const allocator = gpa.allocator();

    var buffer = try allocator.alloc(u8, 1024);
    defer allocator.free(buffer);

    // ... use buffer ...

    std.debug.print("Memory allocated and freed safely!\n", .{});
}
```

**Bad Code (C):**

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
    char *buffer = (char *)malloc(1024); // Memory allocation
    if (buffer == NULL) return 1; //Error Handling

    // ... use buffer ...

    //Missing free() call!  Memory leak.
    return 0; 
}
```


**Key Takeaways:**

* **Memory Safety:** Zig's `defer` statement guarantees that allocated memory is always freed, preventing memory leaks. C requires explicit `free()` calls, which are easily forgotten, leading to leaks.
* **Error Handling:** The Zig example uses `try` to handle potential allocation failures gracefully.  The C example has minimal error handling, potentially causing crashes.
* **Readability and Maintainability:** Zig's explicit memory management, aided by the `defer` keyword, makes the code cleaner and easier to understand and maintain than C's manual approach.  It's easier to reason about memory lifetimes in Zig.
* **Compile-Time Safety:** Zig's compiler helps catch memory errors during compilation, preventing runtime crashes that might only appear in production. C's manual memory management requires extensive testing to catch potential errors.
* **Allocator Management:** Zig's example showcases proper allocator usage and deallocation, demonstrating best practices for managing memory efficiently and preventing fragmentation. The C example lacks this level of detail.
