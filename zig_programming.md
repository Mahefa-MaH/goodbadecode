**Title:** Zig vs. C: Memory Management Strategies

**Summary:**  Zig's built-in memory management features, including allocators and compile-time guarantees, contrast sharply with C's manual memory management, which requires careful attention to prevent memory leaks and dangling pointers.  This leads to significantly different coding styles and levels of safety.


**Good Code (Zig):**

```zig
const std = @import("std");

pub fn main() !void {
    var gpa = std.heap.GeneralPurposeAllocator(.{}){};
    defer _ = gpa.deinit();
    const allocator = gpa.allocator();

    var buf = try allocator.alloc(u8, 10);
    defer allocator.free(buf);

    for (0..10) |i| {
        buf[i] = @intCast(u8, i);
    }

    std.debug.print("Buffer contents: ", .{});
    std.debug.print("{any}\n", .{buf});
}
```

**Bad Code (C):**

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
    unsigned char *buf = (unsigned char *) malloc(10); 
    if (buf == NULL) return 1; //Error handling is minimal

    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        buf[i] = (unsigned char) i;
    }

    printf("Buffer contents: ");
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        printf("%d ", buf[i]);
    }
    printf("\n");

    // free(buf);  Forgot to free! Memory leak!
    return 0;
}
```


**Key Takeaways:**

* **Explicit Memory Management:** Zig's `defer` statement ensures `allocator.free(buf)` is always called, preventing memory leaks.  C requires the programmer to manually manage `free()` calls, which are easily forgotten (as shown in the bad code).
* **Allocator Control:** Zig provides explicit control over memory allocation through allocators, enabling fine-grained management and potentially improved performance. C relies on the system's default allocator, offering less control.
* **Compile-Time Safety:**  Zig's compiler can help detect memory errors at compile time in many cases (e.g. by enforcing correct use of `defer`). C's memory management is entirely runtime-checked (and only partially, if at all, if not using tools like Valgrind).
* **Error Handling:** The Zig example shows more robust error handling (`try`) compared to C's minimal error checking in the `malloc` call.  Failing to check `malloc` can lead to runtime crashes.
* **Code Clarity:** Zig's syntax makes the memory management intent clearer and easier to follow, reducing the likelihood of errors. The C code, while functional (if the `free` call was added), is less explicit about memory ownership and release.
