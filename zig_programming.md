**Title:** Zig vs. C: Memory Management Strategies Compared

**Summary:**  Zig's built-in memory management features, including allocators and error handling, offer improved safety and clarity compared to C's manual memory management, which is prone to errors like dangling pointers and memory leaks.  Zig's compile-time checks enforce stricter memory safety while C relies heavily on runtime checks and programmer discipline.

**Good Code (Zig):**

```zig
const std = @import("std");

pub fn main() !void {
    var gpa = std.heap.GeneralPurposeAllocator(.{}){};
    defer _ = gpa.deinit();
    const allocator = gpa.allocator();

    var buf = try allocator.alloc(u8, 10);
    defer allocator.free(buf);

    for (buf) |*b| {
        b.* = 0;
    }

    std.debug.print("Memory allocated and zeroed successfully.\n", .{});
}
```

**Bad Code (C):**

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
    unsigned char *buf = (unsigned char *)malloc(10); 
    if (buf == NULL) {
        return 1; //Error handling is minimal.
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        buf[i] = 0;
    }

    printf("Memory allocated and zeroed successfully.\n");
    // free(buf); Missing free call leads to memory leak!
    return 0;
}
```


**Key Takeaways:**

* **Explicit Memory Management:** Zig's `allocator.alloc` and `allocator.free` paired with `defer` statements enforce deterministic memory deallocation, preventing memory leaks. C relies on programmer diligence to call `free`, making leaks a common occurrence.

* **Error Handling:** Zig's `try` keyword cleanly handles allocation errors, preventing crashes. C's `malloc` returning `NULL` requires manual error checks, which are often overlooked or handled poorly.

* **Safety:** Zig's compiler performs more extensive checks at compile time to catch errors related to memory management, reducing runtime surprises and improving code robustness. C's runtime checks are less comprehensive, leaving more opportunities for memory-related vulnerabilities.

* **Readability:** Zig's `defer` keyword and structured approach to resource management enhances code readability and maintainability compared to C's more manual and error-prone approach.

* **Allocator Awareness:** Zig encourages explicit allocator selection and management which allows for more fine-grained control over memory and potentially improved performance compared to C's implicit global allocator.
