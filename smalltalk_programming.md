**Title:** Efficient String Concatenation in Smalltalk

**Summary:**  Smalltalk's `Stream` class offers superior performance for string concatenation compared to repeated string appends, especially with numerous strings.  Repeated appends create many intermediate strings, while streams build one efficiently.

**Good Code:**

```smalltalk
stringCollection := #( 'apple' 'banana' 'cherry' 'date' ).

stream := WriteStream on: String new.
stringCollection do: [:each | stream nextPutAll: each; cr]. 
finalString := stream contents.
Transcript show: finalString.  "Displays the concatenated string"
```

**Bad Code:**

```smalltalk
stringCollection := #( 'apple' 'banana' 'cherry' 'date' ).
finalString := ''.
stringCollection do: [:each | finalString := finalString , each , Character cr].
Transcript show: finalString. "Displays the concatenated string"
```

**Key Takeaways:**

* **Efficiency:** The good code uses a `WriteStream`, avoiding the repeated creation and garbage collection of intermediate strings that occur in the bad code.  This leads to significantly better performance, particularly with many strings.
* **Readability:** The good code is more concise and easier to understand. The logic of adding each string and a carriage return is clearly separated.
* **Memory Management:** The bad code creates numerous temporary strings, consuming more memory and increasing garbage collection overhead.  The stream approach minimizes this.
* **Scalability:** The good code scales much better to larger collections of strings. The bad code's performance degrades quadratically with the number of strings.
* **Correctness:** While both versions produce output, the bad code is less idiomatic and more prone to subtle errors with complex string manipulation.  The `WriteStream` approach is a cleaner and more reliable solution for this common task.
