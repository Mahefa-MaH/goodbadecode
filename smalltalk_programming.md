**Title:** Efficient String Concatenation in Smalltalk

**Summary:**  Smalltalk's `String` concatenation can be optimized using `String stream` for better performance, especially with numerous concatenations, avoiding repeated object creation inherent in the `+` operator.


**Good Code:**

```smalltalk
stringStream := WriteStream on: String new.
1 to: 1000 do: [:i | stringStream nextPutAll: i printString; nextPut: $ ].
result := stringStream contents. 
"result now contains '1234567891011...' "
```

**Bad Code:**

```smalltalk
result := ''.
1 to: 1000 do: [:i | result := result , i printString].
"result now contains '1234567891011...' "

```

**Key Takeaways:**

* **Efficiency:** The `WriteStream` approach in the good code avoids repeated string object creation and copying. The `+` operator (or `,`) in the bad code creates a new string object in each iteration, leading to significant performance overhead, especially for large numbers of concatenations.  This is because Smalltalk strings are immutable.

* **Memory Management:** The bad code generates many short-lived intermediate string objects, increasing garbage collection pressure.  The `WriteStream` method is more memory efficient.

* **Readability:** While both examples achieve the same end result, the `WriteStream` approach, while slightly more verbose, is arguably more readable for experienced Smalltalk programmers, explicitly showing the intention of building a string incrementally.

* **Scalability:** The good code scales much better to larger numbers of concatenations, maintaining reasonable performance, whereas the bad code's performance degrades quadratically with the number of concatenations.
