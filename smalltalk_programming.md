**Title:**  Smalltalk: Efficient vs. Inefficient Message Passing

**Summary:**  Efficient Smalltalk leverages the benefits of dynamic dispatch with careful method selection and object structure. Inefficient Smalltalk suffers from excessive method lookups, leading to performance bottlenecks and potential memory issues.


**Good Code:**

```smalltalk
Object subclass: #EfficientPoint
    instanceVariableNames: 'x y'
    classVariableNames: ''
    package: 'Examples' !

EfficientPoint >> initializeX: x Y: y
    x := x.
    y := y.
!

EfficientPoint >> distanceTo: aPoint
    ^ ((self x - aPoint x) squared + (self y - aPoint y) squared) sqrt.
!

EfficientPoint subclass: #OptimizedPoint
    instanceVariableNames: ''
    classVariableNames: ''
    package: 'Examples' !

OptimizedPoint >> initializeX: x Y: y
    x := x.
    y := y.
!

OptimizedPoint >> distanceTo: aPoint
    self isKindOf: OptimizedPoint ifTrue: [^ self optimizedDistanceTo: aPoint].
    ^ super distanceTo: aPoint.
!

OptimizedPoint >> optimizedDistanceTo: aPoint
    "Optimized for specific point type if needed"
    ^ ((self x - aPoint x) squared + (self y - aPoint y) squared) sqrt.

```

This code utilizes inheritance and method specialization (in `OptimizedPoint`) for potential performance gains in specific situations. Method lookup is contained by clear class hierarchies.


**Bad Code:**

```smalltalk
Object subclass: #InefficientPoint
    instanceVariableNames: 'x y'
    classVariableNames: ''
    package: 'Examples' !

InefficientPoint >> initializeX: x Y: y
    x := x.
    y := y.
!

InefficientPoint >> distanceTo: aPoint
    x := self x.  "Redundant assignment"
    y := self y.  "Redundant assignment"
    aX := aPoint x. "Redundant assignment"
    aY := aPoint y. "Redundant assignment"

    ^ ((x - aX) squared + (y - aY) squared) sqrt.
!

InefficientPoint >> extraMethod: aNumber  "Unnecessary method bloating the class"
    ^ aNumber + 1.
!

```

This code exhibits redundant variable assignments, unnecessary methods which can slow down method lookups, and lacks any performance optimization strategies.


**Key Takeaways:**

* **Minimize Redundant Computations:**  The good code avoids unnecessary variable reassignments, directly using instance variables.
* **Efficient Method Lookup:**  Clear inheritance hierarchies and optimized subclassing reduce the time spent searching for methods.
* **Method Specialization:**  The `OptimizedPoint` example demonstrates how to utilize subclassing to bypass slower generic implementations.
* **Avoid Unnecessary Methods:**  The bad code includes a method (`extraMethod`) that adds no value and contributes to increased search time in the method table.
* **Clean Code:**  The good code is well-structured and easy to understand. This promotes maintainability and reduces the risk of introducing errors.
* **Object-Oriented Design:**  Leveraging inheritance and polymorphism improves code organization and extensibility.


This example showcases basic Smalltalk code optimization.  More advanced techniques involving caching, compiler optimizations, and specialized collection classes can further improve performance in real-world scenarios.
