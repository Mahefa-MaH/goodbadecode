**Title:** Efficient String Concatenation in Smalltalk

**Summary:**  Smalltalk's `String` class offers optimized concatenation methods (`yourself`, `append:`), unlike naive string addition which creates numerous intermediate objects. This significantly impacts performance, especially with many concatenations.

**Good Code:**

```smalltalk
string1 := 'Hello'.
string2 := ' '.
string3 := 'World!'.

result := string1 copy.  "Create a copy to avoid modifying the original"
result append: string2.
result append: string3.

Transcript show: result; cr.  "Output: Hello World!"
```

**Bad Code:**

```smalltalk
string1 := 'Hello'.
string2 := ' '.
string3 := 'World!'.

result := string1 + string2 + string3.  "Inefficient string concatenation"

Transcript show: result; cr.  "Output: Hello World!"
```


**Key Takeaways:**

* **Efficiency:** The good code uses `append:` which modifies the string *in place*, avoiding the creation of multiple intermediate strings. The bad code creates two new strings during the '+' operations, resulting in significantly higher memory allocation and garbage collection overhead, especially when dealing with many strings.
* **Immutability:** Smalltalk strings are immutable.  The good code properly handles this by creating a copy of `string1` before appending. The bad code implicitly relies on the compiler's optimization (which might not always be present or predictable across implementations), and it can lead to unexpected results if string1 is subsequently used.
* **Readability:**  While both examples produce the same result, the good code is more explicit about its intent and better reflects Smalltalk's idiomatic approach to string manipulation.  Using `append:` clarifies the intent of modifying an existing string.
* **Memory Management:** The bad code has a considerably higher memory footprint due to the generation of temporary strings. This leads to increased garbage collection cycles, resulting in performance degradation.
