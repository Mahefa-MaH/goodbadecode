**Title:** Efficient String Concatenation in Smalltalk

**Summary:**  Smalltalk's `Stream` offers significantly better performance for concatenating many strings compared to repeated string concatenation using the `+` operator, which creates many intermediate strings.  The `Stream` approach avoids this overhead, leading to substantially faster execution, particularly with large numbers of strings.

**Good Code (using a Stream):**

```smalltalk
stringCollection := #('apple' 'banana' 'cherry' 'date' 'elderberry').

concatenatedString := WriteStream on: String new.
stringCollection do: [:each | concatenatedString nextPutAll: each].
concatenatedString contents.  "Prints: applebananacherrydated elderberry"
```

**Bad Code (using repeated concatenation):**

```smalltalk
stringCollection := #('apple' 'banana' 'cherry' 'date' 'elderberry').

concatenatedString := ''.
stringCollection do: [:each | concatenatedString := concatenatedString , each].

concatenatedString. "Prints: applebananacherrydated elderberry"
```

**Key Takeaways:**

* **Efficiency:** The good code uses a `WriteStream`, which appends to a single string in memory, avoiding the creation of numerous intermediate strings as the bad code does.  This is significantly faster, especially with a large number of strings.

* **Memory Management:**  The repeated concatenation (`+` operator) in the bad code creates many temporary objects that need to be garbage collected, leading to higher memory consumption and slower execution. The stream avoids this overhead.

* **Readability:** While both examples use a loop, the `WriteStream` approach might be slightly more readable as its intention (appending to a stream) is clearer than repeatedly reassigning a growing string.

* **Scalability:** The good code scales much better as the number of strings increases; the bad code's performance degrades quadratically with the input size.

* **Best Practices:** Utilizing streams for string manipulation is a common Smalltalk idiom that promotes efficient and idiomatic code.  It leverages the power of Smalltalk's collection processing capabilities effectively.
