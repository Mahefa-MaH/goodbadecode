**Title:**  Smalltalk: Efficient vs. Inefficient Collection Iteration

**Summary:**  Efficient Smalltalk collection iteration leverages built-in methods like `do:` for optimized traversal, while inefficient approaches rely on manual indexing, which is slower and more error-prone.

**Good Code:**

```smalltalk
myCollection := #(1 2 3 4 5).  "Example collection"

myCollection do: [:each | 
  Transcript show: each; cr. "Process each element efficiently"
].
```

**Bad Code:**

```smalltalk
myCollection := #(1 2 3 4 5).

i := 1.
[ i <= myCollection size ] whileTrue: [
  Transcript show: (myCollection at: i); cr. "Inefficient manual indexing"
  i := i + 1.
].
```


**Key Takeaways:**

* **Performance:** The `do:` method is highly optimized for collection traversal.  Manual indexing using `at:` within a loop incurs significant overhead.

* **Readability:** `do:` provides a concise and expressive way to iterate, enhancing code clarity.  Manual indexing makes the code more complex and harder to understand.

* **Error Prevention:** Manual indexing increases the risk of off-by-one errors or index-out-of-bounds exceptions.  `do:` handles iteration boundaries automatically.

* **Maintainability:**  `do:` leads to more maintainable code. Changes to the collection size don't require modification of the loop control logic as in the manual indexing approach.

* **Smalltalk Idiom:** Utilizing `do:` demonstrates adherence to Smalltalk's idiomatic style, leading to more readable and understandable code for other Smalltalk developers.
