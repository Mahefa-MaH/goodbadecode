**Title:** Scala String Interpolation: Safe vs. Unsafe

**Summary:**  Scala's string interpolation offers both safe (s-interpolators) and unsafe (f-interpolators) methods.  Safe interpolators prevent injection vulnerabilities by escaping special characters, while unsafe interpolators are susceptible to such attacks if input isn't carefully sanitized.

**Good Code (Safe Interpolation):**

```scala
import scala.util.Try

object SafeInterpolation {
  def greetSafely(name: String): String = {
    //Using s-interpolator for safe string interpolation.  
    s"Hello, ${name.replaceAll("""\""", """\\""")}! Welcome to Scala." 
  }

  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    val userName = "User\"Name"; // Example with a quote
    println(greetSafely(userName)) //Output: Hello, User\"Name! Welcome to Scala.

    val potentiallyUnsafeInput = """<script>alert('XSS')</script>"""
    println(greetSafely(potentiallyUnsafeInput)) //Output: Hello, <script>alert('XSS')</script>! Welcome to Scala. (escaped)
  }
}

```

**Bad Code (Unsafe Interpolation):**

```scala
object UnsafeInterpolation {
  def greetUnsafely(name: String): String = {
    // Using f-interpolator which is prone to injection vulnerabilities if input is not sanitized.
    f"Hello, $name! Welcome to Scala."
  }
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    val maliciousInput = "<script>alert('XSS')</script>"
    println(greetUnsafely(maliciousInput)) //Output: Hello, <script>alert('XSS')</script>! Welcome to Scala. (UNSAFE!)
  }
}
```


**Key Takeaways:**

* **Security:**  The "good" code utilizes `s-interpolators` which, while not inherently sanitizing, allows for explicit escaping of special characters, preventing cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. The "bad" code using `f-interpolators` directly inserts user input, making it vulnerable to injection attacks.
* **Maintainability:**  The good code is more explicit about its handling of potential vulnerabilities, making it easier to understand and maintain.  The bad code obscures the potential risk.
* **Readability:**  Both are relatively readable, but the good codeâ€™s explicit escaping improves clarity regarding security considerations.  The bad code's simplicity hides a significant risk.
* **Best Practices:** Always sanitize user input before using it in string interpolations, especially with f-interpolators.  Prefer s-interpolators and use explicit escaping when necessary.  Consider using a well-vetted library for input validation if dealing with complex data.
