**Title:** Lua API Calls: Secure and Efficient Data Handling

**Summary:**  Efficient Lua API calls prioritize error handling and secure data processing, unlike insecure examples which lack these crucial elements, leading to potential vulnerabilities and unexpected behavior.

**Good Code:**

```lua
local http = require("socket.http")

local function fetchJSON(url)
  local response, code, headers = http.request(url)
  if code ~= 200 then
    error("API request failed with status code: " .. code)
  end

  local json = require("json")
  local data = json.decode(response)  --Error handling omitted for brevity, should be added

  if data == nil then
      error("JSON decoding failed")
  end

  return data
end


local apiUrl = "https://api.example.com/data"
local data = fetchJSON(apiUrl)

if data then
    for k,v in pairs(data) do
        print(k .. ": " .. v)
    end
end
```

**Bad Code:**

```lua
local http = require("socket.http")

local function fetchJSON(url)
  local response = http.request(url)
  return json.decode(response) --No error handling, assumes success.  json module needs to be loaded.
end

local apiUrl = "https://api.example.com/data"
local data = fetchJSON(apiUrl)

for k,v in pairs(data) do  -- Assumes data always exists and is well-formed.
    print(k .. ": " .. v)
end
```


**Key Takeaways:**

* **Error Handling:** The good code explicitly checks for HTTP errors (non-200 status codes) and JSON decoding errors, preventing crashes and providing informative error messages.  The bad code silently fails.
* **Security:**  The good example (implicitly, as shown with error handling)  encourages practices to validate data from the API, preventing potential vulnerabilities.  The bad code has no security considerations.
* **Robustness:** The good code is more robust and less prone to unexpected failures due to invalid API responses or network issues. The bad code assumes everything will always work correctly, which is unrealistic.
* **Readability:** The good code is more readable and easier to maintain due to its clear structure and comments.


**Note:**  The `json` library is not a standard Lua library.  You'll likely need to install a JSON library appropriate for your Lua environment (e.g., using LuaRocks).  Error handling within JSON decoding should be explicitly added to the good example for a truly robust solution.  The example provides a foundation for best practices.
