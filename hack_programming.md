**Title:** Secure Password Hashing: bcrypt vs. MD5

**Summary:**  While both bcrypt and MD5 are hashing algorithms, bcrypt is designed for password security, offering adaptive salting and computational cost to resist brute-force attacks, unlike the vulnerable MD5 algorithm.

**Good Code (Python with bcrypt):**

```python
import bcrypt

def hash_password(password):
    salt = bcrypt.gensalt()  # Generate a unique salt
    hashed = bcrypt.hashpw(password.encode('utf-8'), salt)
    return hashed.decode('utf-8')

def check_password(password, hashed_password):
    return bcrypt.checkpw(password.encode('utf-8'), hashed_password.encode('utf-8'))

#Example Usage
password = "MySecretPassword123!"
hashed = hash_password(password)
print(f"Hashed password: {hashed}")
is_match = check_password(password, hashed)
print(f"Password matches: {is_match}")

```

**Bad Code (Python with MD5):**

```python
import hashlib

def hash_password(password):
    return hashlib.md5(password.encode('utf-8')).hexdigest()

def check_password(password, hashed_password):
    return hashlib.md5(password.encode('utf-8')).hexdigest() == hashed_password

# Example Usage (Insecure!)
password = "MySecretPassword123!"
hashed = hash_password(password)
print(f"Hashed password: {hashed}")
is_match = check_password(password, hashed)
print(f"Password matches: {is_match}")
```


**Key Takeaways:**

* **Salt and Pepper:** bcrypt uses adaptive salting (randomly generated for each password), making rainbow table attacks far less effective. MD5 lacks this crucial security feature.
* **Computational Cost:** bcrypt is designed to be computationally expensive, slowing down brute-force attacks.  MD5 is significantly faster, making it vulnerable.
* **Security Updates:** bcrypt is actively developed and improved, while MD5 is considered cryptographically broken and should never be used for password storage.
* **One-way Function:** Both are one-way functions, but bcrypt's design makes it far more resistant to reverse engineering.
* **Library Support:** Using established security libraries like `bcrypt` ensures proper implementation and handling of cryptographic details.  Improper manual implementation of hashing algorithms can introduce significant vulnerabilities.

**Note:**  Always use a strong, well-vetted library for cryptographic operations. Never attempt to implement these functions yourself unless you have deep expertise in cryptography and security best practices.  Even then, it's generally best to rely on tested and maintained libraries.
