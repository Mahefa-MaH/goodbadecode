**Title:** Swift String Manipulation: Efficient vs. Inefficient Approaches

**Summary:**  The key difference lies in leveraging Swift's built-in string manipulation capabilities for optimal performance versus using less efficient, manual character-by-character processing which can lead to increased complexity and performance bottlenecks.


**Good Code:**

```swift
import Foundation

func reverseStringEfficiently(input: String) -> String {
    return String(input.reversed())
}

func countOccurrencesEfficiently(input: String, target: Character) -> Int {
    return input.filter { $0 == target }.count
}


func capitalizeFirstLetter(input: String) -> String {
    guard let first = input.first else { return input }
    return String(first).uppercased() + input.dropFirst()
}


let originalString = "hello, world!"
let reversedString = reverseStringEfficiently(input: originalString)
let occurrenceCount = countOccurrencesEfficiently(input: originalString, target: "l")
let capitalizedString = capitalizeFirstLetter(input: originalString)


print("Original: \(originalString)")
print("Reversed: \(reversedString)")
print("Occurrences of 'l': \(occurrenceCount)")
print("Capitalized: \(capitalizedString)")

```

**Bad Code:**

```swift
import Foundation

func reverseStringInefficiently(input: String) -> String {
    var reversed = ""
    for i in stride(from: input.count - 1, through: 0, by: -1) {
        reversed.append(input[input.index(input.startIndex, offsetBy: i)])
    }
    return reversed
}

func countOccurrencesInefficiently(input: String, target: Character) -> Int {
    var count = 0
    for char in input {
        if char == target {
            count += 1
        }
    }
    return count
}

let originalString = "hello, world!"
let reversedString = reverseStringInefficiently(input: originalString)
let occurrenceCount = countOccurrencesInefficiently(input: originalString, target: "l")

print("Original: \(originalString)")
print("Reversed: \(reversedString)")
print("Occurrences of 'l': \(occurrenceCount)")
```

**Key Takeaways:**

* **Leverage Swift's built-in functions:** The "Good Code" utilizes Swift's optimized methods like `reversed()`, `filter()`, `uppercased()`, and `dropFirst()` for string manipulation. These functions are highly optimized for performance and readability.

* **Avoid manual character iteration:** The "Bad Code" uses manual character-by-character iteration, which is significantly less efficient, especially for larger strings.  This approach is more prone to errors and harder to maintain.

* **Readability and Maintainability:** The good code is more concise and easier to understand, making it more maintainable and less prone to bugs.

* **Performance:** The built-in functions in the good code are generally significantly faster than manual iteration, especially for large strings.  The performance difference becomes more pronounced as the input string size increases.  Manual string manipulation, as shown in the bad code, results in O(n) time complexity for many operations, while Swift's optimized functions can often achieve better performance.
