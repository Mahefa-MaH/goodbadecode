**Title:** COBOL Data Handling: Optimized vs. Inefficient Approaches

**Summary:**  The key difference lies in efficient use of COBOL's built-in features for data manipulation versus inefficient manual string manipulation and redundant calculations.  Optimized code leverages data structures and built-in functions to reduce complexity and improve performance.

**Good Code:**

```cobol
       IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.
       PROGRAM-ID.  GOOD-COBOL-EXAMPLE.
       DATA DIVISION.
       WORKING-STORAGE SECTION.
       01  CUSTOMER-RECORD.
           05  CUSTOMER-NAME       PIC X(30).
           05  CUSTOMER-ID         PIC 9(9).
           05  CUSTOMER-BALANCE    PIC 9(7)V99.
       01  CUSTOMER-TABLE OCCURS 100 TIMES.
           05  CUSTOMER-ENTRY LIKE CUSTOMER-RECORD.

       PROCEDURE DIVISION.
       MAIN-PARAGRAPH.
           PERFORM VARYING I FROM 1 BY 1 UNTIL I > 100
               IF CUSTOMER-ENTRY(I).CUSTOMER-BALANCE > 1000 THEN
                   DISPLAY "Customer " CUSTOMER-ENTRY(I).CUSTOMER-ID " has balance > 1000"
               END-IF
           END-PERFORM.
           STOP RUN.
```

**Bad Code:**

```cobol
       IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.
       PROGRAM-ID.  BAD-COBOL-EXAMPLE.
       DATA DIVISION.
       WORKING-STORAGE SECTION.
       01  CUSTOMER-DATA PIC X(100).
       01  WS-ID PIC 9(9).
       01  WS-BALANCE PIC 9(7)V99.
       01  WS-INDEX PIC 9(3).


       PROCEDURE DIVISION.
       MAIN-PARAGRAPH.
           PERFORM VARYING WS-INDEX FROM 1 BY 1 UNTIL WS-INDEX > 100
               MOVE WS-INDEX TO WS-ID
               MOVE SPACES TO CUSTOMER-DATA
               MOVE CUSTOMER-DATA(1:9) TO WS-ID
               MOVE CUSTOMER-DATA(10:16) TO WS-BALANCE
               IF WS-BALANCE > 1000 THEN
                   DISPLAY "Customer " WS-ID " has balance > 1000"
               END-IF
               ADD 17 TO WS-INDEX
           END-PERFORM.
           STOP RUN.
```


**Key Takeaways:**

* **Data Structures:** The good code uses structured records (`CUSTOMER-RECORD`) and tables (`CUSTOMER-TABLE`), making data access efficient and readable. The bad code uses a single, unstructured string (`CUSTOMER-DATA`), requiring manual substring extraction, which is error-prone and slow.
* **Built-in Functions:** The good code directly accesses fields within the structured data. The bad code manually extracts parts of the string, introducing complexity and potential for off-by-one errors.
* **Readability and Maintainability:** The structured approach of the good code improves readability and makes the code significantly easier to maintain and debug compared to the complex string manipulations in the bad code.
* **Efficiency:**  Direct field access in the good code is far more efficient than the string manipulation in the bad code, especially for large datasets.  The bad code also includes redundant calculations through `ADD 17 TO WS-INDEX`.
* **Error Handling (implied):** While not explicitly shown, the good code's structured approach reduces the risk of errors related to incorrect substring extraction or index manipulation common in the bad example.


This example highlights the importance of leveraging COBOL's strengths in data structuring and avoiding manual string manipulations for improved efficiency, readability, and maintainability.  The bad example shows how easily a program can become complex and error prone when basic COBOL features are ignored.
