**Title:** Efficient Resource Management in Java EE: Connection Pools vs. Direct Connections

**Summary:**  Direct database connections lead to resource exhaustion and scalability issues in Java EE applications, while connection pooling efficiently manages a limited set of connections, improving performance and reliability.

**Good Code (Using a Connection Pool - HikariCP example):**

```java
import com.zaxxer.hikari.HikariConfig;
import com.zaxxer.hikari.HikariDataSource;

import javax.sql.DataSource;
import java.sql.Connection;
import java.sql.SQLException;

public class DatabaseConnection {

    private static DataSource dataSource;

    static {
        HikariConfig config = new HikariConfig();
        config.setJdbcUrl("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydatabase");
        config.setUsername("myuser");
        config.setPassword("mypassword");
        config.setMaximumPoolSize(10); // Adjust as needed
        config.setMinimumIdle(2);     // Adjust as needed
        dataSource = new HikariDataSource(config);
    }

    public static Connection getConnection() throws SQLException {
        return dataSource.getConnection();
    }

    public static void closeConnection(Connection connection) {
        try {
            if (connection != null) {
                connection.close();
            }
        } catch (SQLException e) {
            // Log the exception appropriately.  Don't swallow it.
            e.printStackTrace(); // Replace with proper logging in production
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) throws SQLException {
        Connection connection = getConnection();
        // Use the connection here...
        closeConnection(connection);
    }
}
```

**Bad Code (Direct Connection):**

```java
import java.sql.Connection;
import java.sql.DriverManager;
import java.sql.SQLException;

public class DatabaseConnectionBad {

    public static Connection getConnection() throws SQLException {
        return DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydatabase", "myuser", "mypassword");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) throws SQLException {
        Connection connection = getConnection();
        // Use the connection here...
        // connection.close(); // Often forgotten, leading to resource leaks.
    }
}
```

**Key Takeaways:**

* **Resource Management:** The good code utilizes a connection pool (HikariCP in this example), efficiently managing a limited number of database connections.  The bad code creates a new connection for each request, leading to potential resource exhaustion and performance bottlenecks.
* **Scalability:** Connection pooling allows an application to handle many concurrent requests without needing to establish a new database connection for each one, improving scalability.
* **Error Handling:** The good code includes robust error handling in the `closeConnection` method to ensure resources are released even in case of exceptions.  The bad code lacks proper resource cleanup, potentially leading to connection leaks and database instability.
* **Connection Lifetime:**  The pool manages the life cycle of connections; ensuring they are reused and closed properly.  Direct connections often lack this management, resulting in unnecessary connections left open.
* **Performance:** Connection establishment is an expensive operation.  Pooling drastically reduces the number of times this happens, significantly improving performance.
* **Security:** While not directly addressed in this example, connection pooling can often integrate with security features like connection encryption and authentication more seamlessly than managing individual connections.


**Note:**  Remember to include the HikariCP dependency in your `pom.xml` (if using Maven) or equivalent build file.  Replace placeholder database credentials with your actual values.  Always use a proper logging framework in a production environment instead of `e.printStackTrace()`.
