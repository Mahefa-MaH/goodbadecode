**Title:** Racket: Safe vs. Unsafe I/O Operations

**Summary:**  Safe I/O operations in Racket use `call-with-input-file` and `call-with-output-file` to handle potential errors gracefully, while unsafe methods directly use ports, leading to potential crashes or security vulnerabilities if not managed perfectly.

**Good Code:**

```racket
#lang racket

(define (read-file filename)
  (with-handlers ([exn:fail? (lambda (exn)
                               (displayln "Error reading file: " (exn-message exn))
                               #f)]) ;Return #f on failure
    (call-with-input-file filename
      (lambda (port)
        (read-string port)))))

(define filename "mydata.txt")
(let ([data (read-file filename)])
  (when data
    (displayln "File contents: " data)))

(define (write-file filename data)
  (call-with-output-file filename
    (lambda (port)
      (display data port))))

(write-file "output.txt" "Hello from safe I/O!")

```

**Bad Code:**

```racket
#lang racket

(define (read-file-unsafe filename)
  (let ([port (open-input-file filename)])
    (let ([data (read-string port)])
      (close-input-port port)
      data)))

(define filename "mydata.txt")
(let ([data (read-file-unsafe filename)])
  (displayln "File contents (unsafe): " data))


(define (write-file-unsafe filename data)
  (let ([port (open-output-file filename)])
    (display data port)
    (close-output-port port)))

(write-file-unsafe "output_unsafe.txt" "Hello from unsafe I/O!")

```

**Key Takeaways:**

* **Error Handling:** The good code uses `with-handlers` to gracefully handle potential `exn:fail?` exceptions (e.g., file not found), preventing program crashes. The bad code lacks this crucial error handling.
* **Resource Management:**  `call-with-input-file` and `call-with-output-file` automatically close the file ports, even if exceptions occur, preventing resource leaks.  The bad code requires explicit `close-input-port` and `close-output-port` calls, which can be easily forgotten, leading to resource exhaustion.
* **Security:** While not explicitly shown here, unsafe direct port manipulation can create vulnerabilities if not carefully managed (e.g., improper handling of user-supplied filenames).  The safer approach reduces the attack surface.
* **Readability and Maintainability:** The good code is more concise and easier to understand due to its structured approach to error handling and resource management.
