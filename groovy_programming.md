**Title:** Groovy List Iteration: Efficient vs. Inefficient Approaches

**Summary:**  Groovy offers several ways to iterate over lists, but using `each` provides conciseness and readability compared to manual index-based loops, which are prone to errors and less expressive.

**Good Code:**

```groovy
def numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

// Efficient and readable iteration using 'each'
numbers.each { number ->
    println "Number: $number"
    // Perform operations on 'number'
}

//Alternative using the implicit parameter 'it'
numbers.each { println "Number: $it" }

//For more complex logic using eachWithIndex
numbers.eachWithIndex { number, index ->
    println "Number $number at index $index"
}
```

**Bad Code:**

```groovy
def numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

// Inefficient and error-prone index-based loop
for (int i = 0; i < numbers.size(); i++) {
    println "Number: ${numbers.get(i)}" // More verbose and less readable
    // Potential for off-by-one errors and unnecessary array access
}
```


**Key Takeaways:**

* **Readability and Maintainability:** The `each` method is significantly more concise and easier to read than the manual index-based loop. This improves code maintainability and reduces the chance of errors.
* **Efficiency:**  While the performance difference might be negligible for small lists, `each` often leverages Groovy's optimized internal methods, potentially offering slight performance gains, especially with large datasets.  The `get(i)` method adds overhead compared to the implicit access in `each`.
* **Error Prevention:** Index-based loops are prone to off-by-one errors and other index-related bugs. `each` eliminates this risk, making your code more robust.
* **Expressiveness:** The `each` method directly expresses the intent of iterating over the list without getting bogged down in index management.  This leads to cleaner, more declarative code.
* **Flexibility:**  The `eachWithIndex` method provides a concise way to access both the element and its index when needed, avoiding the need for manual index tracking.
